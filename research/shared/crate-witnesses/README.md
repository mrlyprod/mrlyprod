# crate-witnesses

- The `80` crate tests the research notes cite, back as witnesses against the split crates of `packages/rs`.
- Source: the inline tests of `crates/math`, `crates/num` and `crates/life` at commit `559ca940`, the last to carry them.
- One module a source file, named for the crate module it witnesses.
- The bodies are the originals but for the crate paths. One helper differs: `counts_faces::brute` builds its `Skeleton` field by field, `Skeleton::from_counts` being private.
- A note cites a witness as `crate-witnesses <name>`, the two words the command takes.

## RUN

- `bash research/scripts/witness.sh crate-witnesses` from the repo root: `80` witnesses, about `22` s, `21.6` s of it `the_deep_slices_hold_their_spectral_exponents`.
- `bash research/scripts/witness.sh crate-witnesses <name>` runs one.
- `the_classics_close` names two witnesses, one in `counts_faces` and one in `counts_surface`; asking for it runs both.
