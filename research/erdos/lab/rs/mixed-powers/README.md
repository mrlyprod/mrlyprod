# mixed-powers

- Computes, for a finite base set `D` of integers `>= 3` and a level `k >= 1`, whether every large integer is a sum of distinct terms of the multiset `M_k(D)` of powers `d^j`, `d` in `D`, `j >= k`, one copy per base: Erdos problem 124 at one level.
- The certificate is the surplus certificate of `research/erdos/notes/problem-124.md`: the sums `P_n` of the `n` least terms are held as one bit array, each term folded in by one shift-or pass, and after each term `T = 1 + max{x <= S_n/2 : x not in P_n}` is read by a word scan down from `S_n/2`; when `T <= a_(n+1)` and the step `a_(m+1) <= S_m - 2T + 1` holds until the surplus `(sigma - 1) a_(m+1) >= C_k + 2T - 1` takes over, the level is complete and `F = T - 1` is the largest integer that is no sum. The step check runs over the terms up to `10^30` in exact integer arithmetic, `sigma` and `C_k` over the common denominator of the `d - 1`.
- The census enumerates the base sets in `[3, R]` minimal for `sigma > 1` and `gcd = 1`, every other such set containing one, and certifies each at `k = 1, 2, ...` until a cell passes the bit cap.
- The wide certificate keeps only `P_n` meet `[0, W]` as bits and the holes of `P_n` in `(W, S_n/2]` as a sorted list capped at `2^25`, exact for `S_n < 2^63`, by the update rule proved on the note, so a level closes on `W` bits where the full array needs `S_n`; at the close it sorts every non-sum by its route, below the least term, window or pair. A capped cell returns `Cap` either because the list passes `2^25` or because the candidates of one step past `S_n` do, without saying which.
- The route verb reads, per minimal base set, the least `sum(M_1(D) below N)/N` over terms `N` in `[10^E, 10^30]`, truncated to six places, the quantity that bounds two-part partitions below `sigma = 2`.
- The 3-adic verbs hold Erdos problem 406 in the relaxation of Lagarias and Abram and Lagarias: `C(1, M_1, ..., M_r)` is the set of 3-adic integers `lambda` with every digit of `lambda` and of each `M_i lambda` in `{0, 1}`, read by the carry automaton whose state is the vector of carries of the `M_i lambda`; the dimension is `log_3` of the largest spectral radius over its reachable strongly connected components, bracketed by the least and largest ratio of a power iterate, and the prefix test decides `C = {0}` from the `M_i mod 3^D`, the powers `2^m` reduced modulo `3^D`, so the exponents matter only modulo `2 3^(D - 1)`, with `D <= 79`, exact in `u128`.

## VERBS

- `census R K BITS THREADS`: every minimal base set in `[3, R]` at `k = 1..K` with a `2^BITS`-bit array per cell; prints `F`, the count of positive non-sums up to `F`, the index `n` and term `a_n` of the certificate, `S_n`, the term where the surplus takes over, and the depth histogram. Runtime `2.9` s at `census 10 5 32 4`, `8.7` s at `census 12 5 32 4`, on `4` threads, `512` MB per thread.
- `deep R K BITS THREADS`: the census through the wide certificate at `W = 2^BITS`, each cell also printing its non-sums by route and the route of `F`, and per level the cells whose `F` comes by each route. Runtime `21.3` s at `deep 10 6 31 4`, `2.8` s at `deep 12 3 31 4`, on `4` threads.
- `wcell D K BITS`: one cell through the wide certificate. Runtime `1.8` s at `wcell 3,4,5 5 33`, `0.9` s at `wcell 3,4,6 4 33`, `3.6` to `5.4` s at `W = 2^33` and `13.1` to `14.7` s at `W = 2^34` on the `k = 5` cells of the note, `2` GB at `W = 2^34`.
- `wcontrol BITS`: every cell of the minimal sets in `[3, 10]` at `k <= 4` that the full certificate settles within `2^30` bits, against the wide certificate at `W = 2^BITS`. Runtime `6.8` s at `wcontrol 16`: `109` agree, none differ. It samples only `k <= 4`, bases up to `10` and `S_n <= 2^30`, never the cap path or the scale of the `k = 5` cells.
- `split D K X COUNT`: the non-sums in `[X, X + COUNT)` by a meet in the middle over the terms up to `X + COUNT`, independent of the bit array. Runtime `0.3` s at `split 3,4,5 5 31333640736 64`.
- `chainless BITS`: the multiset `4, 5, 6, 7, 12, 18, 31, ...` of the note, `a_(n+2) = S_n - y_n - y_(n+1)`, up to `2^BITS`: windows, the least of `2 (S_n - a_(n+1)) - a_(n+1)`, the values of `a_(n+3) - a_(n+2) - a_(n+1)`, the chain of non-sums `a_(n+1) + y_n` and every non-sum by route. Runtime under `0.1` s at `chainless 27`.
- `forced BITS`: the multiset of `chainless` with `a_(n+2) = S_n + 2` or `S_n + 3` forced at `n >= 6`, `n = 0 mod 6, 8, 10`: open windows, chained pairs, the least of `2 (S_n - a_(n+1)) - a_(n+1)`, the non-sums below the last term and those in the last `12` term intervals. Runtime under `0.1` s at `forced 26`.
- `windowed BITS`: the multiset `V = 4, 5, 6, 7, 13, 19, 47, ...` of the note, `a_(n+2) = S_n - u_n - u_(n+1)` with `u_n` set from the chain holes `x_n = a_(n+1) + u_n`, up to `2^BITS`: sortedness, the windows and their least width over the term, chained pairs, windows holding a non-sum, the least of `12 (S_n - a_(n+1)) - a_(n+1)`, the largest `a_(n+1) - 3 a_n`, the values of `a_(n+3) - a_(n+2) - a_(n+1)` at `n = 3 mod 5` from `3`, the chain of non-sums `x_n` and every non-sum by route. Runtime under `0.1` s at `windowed 27`.
- `jumps R K BITS THREADS`: every minimal base set in `[3, R]` at `k = 1..K` through the wide certificate at `W = 2^BITS`, logging `S_n` and `T_n` at every step: checks the jump law of the note on every step, and prints per cell the rises of `T`, the birth step `b` of `F`, `F - a_(b+1)`, whether `T_b - 1 > R_b`, `R_b = S_b - a_(b+1)`, the route of `F`, the peak of `T_n/a_(n+1)` after the last base enters, and per capped cell the run of rises open at the cap; then per level the counts, the largest and least peaks, the gap from the last rise to the certificate, the cells run and the violations of the jump law and the route lemma; it stops a base set at its first capped level. Runtime `16.6` s at `jumps 10 6 31 4` on `4` threads, `3.5` GB peak resident, `1.8` GB on `2` threads; the holes past the window ride as `u64` in two buffers swapped each step, `2^28` bytes each, so a capped cell holds `W/8` bytes of bits and `2^29` of holes.
- `trace D K BITS`: one cell step by step: `a_n`, its base, `S_n`, `a_(n+1)`, `R_n = S_n - a_(n+1)`, `T_n`, `T_n/a_(n+1)`, and `rises` on the rows `n` with `T_(n+1) > T_n`. Runtime under `0.1` s at `trace 3,4,5 3 26`.

- `set D K B`: the same base set read as a set of powers, ties counted once, by a plain knapsack to `B`; prints the largest non-sum below `B`. Runtime under `0.01` s at `set 3,5,6,9 1 20000`, which reads `649` against the multiset's `F = 22`.
- `windows D K E F`: over the terms `a_(n+1)` in `[10^E, 10^F]` of `M_K(D)`, the count of windows `a_(n+2) > S_n` and of pairs `m < n` of windows where the upper window `(S_m, a_(m+2))` meets the lower window `(S_n - a_(n+1), a_(n+2) - a_(n+1))`. Runtime under `0.01` s at `windows 3,4,5 1 6 30`: `27` of `123`, no pair.
- `graham T P Q BITS`: the set `floor(T (P/Q)^n)`, `n >= 1`, up to `2^BITS`, exact in integers; the count of windows and of windows holding a non-sum, and the largest non-sum up to `2^(BITS-1)`. Runtime under `0.1` s at `graham 2 5 3 26`: `31` windows, all holding a non-sum, largest `23559582`.
- `refute BITS`: the set `2 F_m - 1`, `m >= 2`, up to `2^BITS`, which refutes the surplus lemma L of the note: the least of `2 (S_n - a_(n+1)) - a_(n+1)`, the windows and those holding a non-sum, and the non-sums below `10^6`. Runtime under `0.1` s at `refute 27`: `36` windows, all holding a non-sum.
- `ternary N HI THREADS`: `g_3(n)` of Erdos problem 817 for `n = 1..N`, exhaustive: for each largest element in turn, a search from the top down over sets whose `3^n` ternary sums are distinct, one bit array of sums, pruned by `g_3(r)` of the run before and by `sum a_i^2 >= (9^n - 1)/8`. Runtime `5.9` s at `ternary 6 200 8`.

Runtime `342` s at `sweep 7 169 473 8`, which finds none, against `36` s for `probe 7 380 8` alone.

## READS

- `30` minimal base sets in `[3, 10]`, all certified at `k = 1, 2, 3`, `21` at `k = 4`, `5` at `k = 5`; `103` in `[3, 12]`, all at `k = 1, 2` with `{3, 6, 9, 10, 12}` at `k = 2` from the cell verb, `F = 1473914231`.
- `F({3, 4, 5}, k)` at `k = 1..4`: `79, 77613, 4330731, 1075364603`, with `11, 1128, 45704, 1785062` positive non-sums up to `F`; `F({3, 4, 6}, k)` at `k = 1..3`: `986, 242113, 58941162`.
- The one base set in `[3, 12]` with `sigma = 1` and `gcd = 1` is `{3, 4, 7}`, outside the certificate.
- Through the wide certificate: all `30` minimal sets in `[3, 10]` at `k = 4`, `28` at `k = 5`, `{3, 5, 6, 7}` and `{4, 5, 6, 7, 9}` at `k = 6`; `F({3, 4, 5}, 5) = 31333640736` with `100335626` non-sums; `F({3, 4, 6}, 4) = 14059625243`; `101` of the `103` in `[3, 12]` at `k = 3`.
- From `k = 4` on every certified cell makes `F` by the pair route.
- `V` up to `2^27`: `37` terms, `7` windows at `n = 5, 10, ..., 35`, none chained, all holding a non-sum, least width `0.255` of the term; `33` chain values, all non-sums.
- The jump law holds on every step of the `173` cells `jumps` reaches at `W = 2^31`; `T_n/a_(n+1)` after the last base enters peaks at `1.9430` and passes `1.1727` in every certified cell with `k >= 2`; all `28` capped cells sit in one open run of rises.
- Route ratios over `[10^12, 10^30]` for the `30` minimal base sets in `[3, 10]`: between `1.105953` and `1.537469`.
- `F({3, 4, 7}, k)` at `k = 1..4` by the tight certificate: `581, 3982888, 166025260, 14961204826`, with `37, 5207, 391070, 23496512` positive non-sums up to `F`, `B = 8, 16, 19, 23`; `k = 5` caps at `W = 2^34` with `2^26` holes at term `40`.
- Smooth-pair sets, `sigma = 1`, at most six bases in `[3, 47]`: `52` of `62`, all closed at `k = 1..4`, `51` at `k = 5`, `{3, 4, 7}` capping at term `40` at `W = 2^35`; `F({3, 4, 10, 19}, k) = 251, 66091, 4138541, 1052160335, 271729742861` at `k = 1..5`; largest `H` `186717655760522`.
- `g_3(n) = 1, 3, 8, 22, 60, 168, 474` at `n = 1..7` for Erdos problem 817; `474` has one extremal set and `168` two.
- `C(1, 2^a, 2^b, 2^c) = {0}` for all `561375500` triples of even exponents up to `3000`, every prefix test dead by length `50`, deepest at `(2, 8, 332)`; up to `124` every triple automaton has at most `35` states.
- Pairs of even exponents up to `40`: `177` empty, `3` countable, `10` of positive dimension, the largest `0.228391` at `(2, 8)`.
- `dim C(1, 2^8) = 0.306871`, radius `1.400924990`; `dim C(1, 2^m)` in `[0.259662, 0.262985]` at `m = 16..38`.
- Classes of triples dead by length `D`: `0.691358, 0.818777, 0.894353, 0.937762, 0.963267` at `D = 3..7`.
