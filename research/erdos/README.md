# Erdos problems

The open Erdos problems that are questions about digit designs, ranked by the odds of a checked result and by who reads them, and problem 124 attacked: sums of powers of several bases, where a bitset certificate makes each complete level a finite computation, every base set up to `10` with `sum 1/(d-1) > 1` and `gcd = 1` is certified at the first four levels, and the two-part route of the literature is proved unable to reach any base set below `sum 1/(d-1) = 2`, while two window criteria fall to explicit incomplete multisets.

## Lost

- Problem 124 at every level by a finite certificate alone: the certificate passes completeness only downward in `k`, the deepest hole grows with `k`, and at `{3, 4, 5}` level 6 leaves the box; the levels closed are in [claims/erdos.md](claims/erdos.md).
- Problem 125's upper density by finite runs: the rows need `liminf h_k(tau_k) < infinity`, which no finite run reaches; the lower density was settled elsewhere.
- The two-part route of Fan and of Bergelson and Simmons below `sum 1/(d-1) = 2`: no two disjoint infinite parts of the powers are both syndetic there (The two-part route is dead below two).
- Linear surplus with `H_1 = {0}` as a completeness criterion: `2 F_m - 1` is incomplete; the Refuted row in [claims/erdos.md](claims/erdos.md).
- The chain-excluded lemma and its windowed repair: explicit multisets with surplus, `H_1 = {0}` and no chain are incomplete, so no window criterion decides problem 124 (The windowed lemma).
