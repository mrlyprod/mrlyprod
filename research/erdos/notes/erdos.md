title: Erdos problems
lead: The open Erdos problems that are questions about digit designs, ranked by the odds of a checked result and by who reads them, and problem 124 attacked: sums of powers of several bases, where a bitset certificate makes each complete level a finite computation, every base set up to `10` with `sum 1/(d-1) > 1` and `gcd = 1` is certified at the first four levels, and the two-part route of the literature is proved unable to reach any base set below `sum 1/(d-1) = 2`, while two window criteria fall to explicit incomplete multisets.

A digit design is a set of integers whose base-`d` digits lie in a set `F`, and a surprising share of the open problems at [erdosproblems.com](https://www.erdosproblems.com) are statements about one, about a sumset of two in different bases, or about the carries that Kummer's theorem turns into divisibility. This page ranks those problems, then attacks the top one, problem 124, with the machinery of [Two bases](../../cobham/notes/cobham.md): the sumset of designs across bases held as one bit array.

`lab/rs/mixed-powers` is the generator behind every number below.

## The objects

- `P(d, k)` is the set of sums of distinct powers `d^j` with `j >= k`, which is `d^k` times the base-`d` design `{0, 1}`.
- A base set is a finite `D = {d_1 < ... < d_r}` of integers `>= 3`; `M_k(D)` is the multiset of the powers `d_i^j`, `j >= k`, one copy per base, so `sum_i P(d_i, k)` is the set `FS(M_k(D))` of sums of distinct terms of `M_k(D)`.
- `sigma(D) = sum_i 1/(d_i - 1)` and `C_k(D) = sum_i d_i^k/(d_i - 1)`.
- `M_k(D)` is complete when `FS(M_k(D))` contains every large integer; `F(D, k)` is then the largest integer outside it.
- `a_1 <= a_2 <= ...` is `M_k(D)` sorted, `S_n = a_1 + ... + a_n`, and `P_n` the set of sums of distinct terms among the first `n`, a subset of `[0, S_n]` symmetric under `x -> S_n - x`.

## The ranked scouting table

Rank is the odds of a checked result in one sitting times the readership; status is the site's own; a problem this tree already carries is marked and not reopened.

Problem 125 is Object S of [Two bases](../../cobham/notes/cobham.md) and stays there.

## Chapters

- [Problem 124](problem-124.md): Problem 124 attacked with a bitset certificate: what is in print, the surplus certificate, the two-part route proved dead below two, the census of certified base sets, the missing lemma, the two routes, the windowed lemma, the deepest hole and the sigma-one set.
- [Problems 817 and 406](problems-817-406.md): Problem 817 at n = 7 and problem 406 in the 3-adic integers, each settled by a finite computation.

## What stays open

- **Conjecture.** `M_k({3, 4, 5})` is complete at every `k`, the least base set outside every theorem whose proof is read here; checked at `k <= 5` with no derivation. A proof has to hold uniformly in `k`, while the only uniform tool read here, the two-part criterion, is dead below `sigma = 2`.
- **Proved (the target as one inequality).** If `1 < sigma(D) < 2`, then `M_k(D)` is complete exactly when some `n` has `2 T_n - 1 <= (sigma(D) - 1) a_(n+1) - C_k(D)`, with `T_n = 1 + max{x <= S_n/2 : x not in P_n}`. Proof: at such an `n`, `T_n < a_(n+1)` since `sigma - 1 < 1`, and the surplus clause of the certificate is empty because `a_(m+1) >= a_(n+1)` for `m >= n`; conversely, along the steps of the gap proof `T_n = F(D, k) + 1` while `a_(n+1)` grows without bound.
- So a proof for `{3, 4, 5}`, where `sigma - 1 = 1/12`, is a bound uniform in `k` that brings the deepest hole of `P_n` below about `a_(n+1)/24`. A criterion whose window clause a windowless multiset satisfies cannot supply it: the chain-excluded lemma is refuted above by a multiset with no window, and the pair route makes every `F` of the census from `k = 4` on; the windowed lemma is refuted by `V`, whose windows open at every fifth step. Such a bound cannot hold while the births run: the step after a rise has `S_(n+1) - a_(n+2) <= 2 T_(n+1) - 2`, so the one inequality fails there, every rise lands past `S_n/2`, and every certified cell with `k >= 2` has `T_n > 1.17 a_(n+1)` after its last base enters. At `sigma = 1` the surplus is `-C`, and for `{3, 4, 7}` an exact deficit and Ellison's bound make each complete level a finite run, a level being complete exactly when its run closes, closed here through `k = 4`.
