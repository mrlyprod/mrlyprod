# Cuts

The slice sign law: the central diagonal cut of the `D`-dimensional middle-digit solid obeys a recurrence of order `ceil(D/2)` and grows strictly slower than a generic cut in every even dimension at bases 3 and 5, and at least as fast in every odd dimension at base 3.

## Lost

- A fixed-epsilon spectral separation for the slice transfer matrix: none is expected, `lambda_1/abs(lambda_2)` reading `(dim+2)/(dim-2) + O(dim^-3)` and tending to 1 on the computed range, a conjecture; the row in [claims/slice-sign-law-in-every-dimension.md](claims/slice-sign-law-in-every-dimension.md).
- Lemma H by a single prime (`H det M_even != 0` from one nonzero residue): dead for every prime `p <= 59` on `dim = 2..40`, with `61, 67, 73, 97` dividing no determinant there and untested beyond; `v_p(det M_even) > 0` at `dim = 2..40` for `p = 2` at 39 of 39 dims, `p = 3` at 38, `p = 5` at 19 and `p = 7` at 13, and every prime `p <= 59` divides it at some `dim <= 30` (`dim = 5` for `p = 5`, `dim = 7` for `p = 7`, `dim = 30` for `p = 41`), `v_3` reaching 181 at `dim = 40`; the row in [claims/diagonal-slice-ladder.md](claims/diagonal-slice-ladder.md).
