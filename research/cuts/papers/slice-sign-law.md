title: The Slice Sign Law
lead: The central diagonal slice of the `D`-dimensional middle-digit solid in an odd base `q` has a census that obeys a linear recurrence of order `ceil(D/2)`, and its growth rate `rho_D` misses the generic value `f_D/q` on the side fixed by the parity of `D`; the odd half is a product of cosines, the even half at bases `3` and `5` is a Collatz-Wielandt certificate closed analytically, the base-`3` certificate pays a quadratic transient whose length is `(log R / 4) D^2 + O(D)` with `R = 1.2553249438...` and is pinned to three odd values, and the strictness still owed in one residue class reduces to a `2`-adic valuation whose first layer is a tent built from the Jacobsthal numbers.

## Introduction

![One strip for each even dimension D from 6 to 40, top to bottom, one cell per odd level L from 1 to 91, left to right, a cell inked blue where the census excess V(L) is negative: every strip is one unbroken run of blue from L = 1 to the last negative level L*(D), the right ends of the runs tracing the parabola 0.0568 D^2, and a yellow tick on every strip marks the crossing K*(D) of the two leading frequencies, always within one odd step of the run's end; on the strip D = 40 the tick sits at 88.77 and the run ends at 87.](paper-slice-sign-law)

Take a cube, cut it into `27` equal subcubes, and discard the seven that touch the middle of a face or the middle of the cube; twenty survive. Repeat inside each survivor forever and the limit is the Menger sponge. Cut the sponge by the plane through its centre perpendicular to a main diagonal and count the cubes the plane meets at each stage of the construction. That count is an integer sequence, and the questions here are how much memory it has and how fast it grows.

Both questions make sense in every dimension and every odd base. Fix an odd base `q` with middle digit `m = (q-1)/2` and a dimension `D >= 2`; the two letters stand for the base and the dimension throughout. In the `D`-dimensional base-`q` grid keep a cell exactly when at most one of its `D` digits equals `m`; at `q = 3`, `D = 3` this is the sponge, and at `q = 3` and general `D` the `D`-dimensional Menger analog. Refine `L` times, cut along the main diagonal, and let `a_D(L)` count the cells the central hyperplane meets. The whole solid has `f_D^L` cells, `f_D = (q-1)^(D-1)(q-1+D)` the fill, so a generic hyperplane should meet about `f_D^L/q^L` of them, and the generic growth rate is `f_D/q`. The guess is never right, and the side it misses on is decided by the parity of `D` alone:

```
rho_D > f_D/q  at odd D ,    rho_D < f_D/q  at even D ,
```

where `rho_D` is the growth rate of the census, the Perron root of an integer matrix of size `ceil(D/2)` built in Section 2. That is the sign law. In terms of dimensions, `log_q rho_D` is the counting exponent of the slice and `log_q f_D - 1` the generic one, the dimension of the solid less one, so the exponent of the central slice sits strictly above the generic value in odd dimensions and strictly below it in even ones.

The results, in the order the paper proves them. Theorem 3.1: the census obeys a constant-coefficient linear recurrence of order at most `ceil(D/2)` at every odd base and every `D`, a fourfold sharpening of the order `2D+1` the untrimmed carry automaton gives for free, with exactness equivalent to one nonzero Hankel determinant (Theorem 3.2) and proved at base `3` for `2 <= D <= 14` and at every odd base for `2 <= D <= 10` (Theorem 3.3). Theorem 5.2: the odd half, `rho_D >= f_D/3` at every odd `D` at base `3` with strict inequality when `D` is not `1 mod 3`, from the product of cosines of Theorem 5.1, whose every term ends in the factor `(-1)^(D-1)(D-1)`; Proposition 4.2 carries the non-strict inequality to every odd base. Theorems 6.1 and 7.1: the even half entire at base `5` and at base `3`, `rho_D < f_D/q` for every even `D >= 2`, by one machine, a Collatz-Wielandt certificate at a depth that is `Theta(log D)` at base `5` and `Theta(D^2)` at base `3`. Theorem 8.1: the base-`3` transient is the crossing of the half-point frequency, its length `(log R / 4)(D^2 - D) + O(D)` with `R = prod_(i >= 2) cos(pi/3^i)/cos(2 pi/3^i) = 1.2553249438...`, and the last negative level `L*(D)` lies within one odd step of the greatest odd integer `L_0(D)` below the crossing `K*(D)`, one of three values; Proposition 8.2 gives a per-`D` condition that pins it to `L_0`, and Fact 8.3 reads `L* = L_0` on every even `6 <= D <= 120`. Lemma 8.4: base `3` is the only hard base, because it is the only odd base at which the digit polynomial has the same modulus at `-1` as at `1`. Theorem 9.1: the mod-`2` nullity of the even carry block at odd `D` is a tent function with corners at the Jacobsthal numbers, the first layer of the `2`-adic valuation that strictness in the last residue class still needs.

What is still owed is one word, strictly, in one residue class per base: at base `3` strictness at odd `D = 1 mod 3` is proved through `D = 241` and open beyond; at base `5` the odd class `D = 1 mod 5` has only the non-strict inequality of Proposition 4.2. Section 5 reduces that word to an upper bound on `v_2(det M_even)`, and Section 9 proves the first layer of that bound; the rest is the Open problems.

How the even half falls. A test vector `beta_K`, the all-ones vector pushed `K` steps through the transposed carry matrix, certifies `rho_D < f_D/q` the moment `q beta_(K+1) < f_D beta_K` holds entrywise, an exact integer test that gives strictness for free. The work is showing that some `K` always exists. In an exact Fourier form `beta_K` is a sum over frequencies modulo `q^K`, the leading fill powers cancel identically, and the certificate becomes positivity of one trigonometric sum `Sigma_K(c)` on a window of carries. At base `5` one frequency dominates every other by a factor `0.768` per unit of `D`, and depth `Theta(log D)` closes everything. At base `3` a second frequency, the one riding the fixed point `pi` of angle tripling, fights the first at comparable strength, wins while `K` is small, and loses at depth `Theta(D^2)`. That fight is the transient. Its two leaders cross at `K*(D)`, and the argument decides the sign of the census excess `V(L)` at every level outside a window around the crossing whose width is the mass of all the other frequencies; the window can hold at most one odd level, so the last negative level is `L_0 - 2`, `L_0` or `L_0 + 2`. An earlier two-value form of that statement, `L_0 - 2` or `L_0`, does not follow from the proof: at `D = 40` the crossing is `K* = 88.7719`, the window has half-width `0.42` in `K`, and the odd level `89 = L_0 + 2` sits inside it, so the proof leaves `L* in {87, 89}` there and the sweep of Fact 8.3 settles it as `87`. Theorem 8.1 is stated with the three values, and Proposition 8.2 names the arithmetic condition on `K*(D)` under which the window is empty and `L* = L_0` exactly.

What is not new. Carry chains for adding `D` numbers in base `q` are classical, and their transition matrix is Holte's amazing matrix; the matrix here differs in two ways, a joint restriction on the digits and a pinned rather than summed output digit, as Section 10 spells out. That some constant-coefficient recurrence exists is free: a finite carry state space makes `a_D(L)` a `q`-regular sequence, and the untrimmed automaton on states `-D, ..., D` hands over order `2D + 1` with no argument. The `D = 3` object is famous, a hexagon full of six-pointed stars, with its hexagon-triangle substitution matrix and dimension `1.8184` in print; the integers `1, 6, 42, 306, 2250, 16578, 122202` are A299916 up to an index shift, whose Menger reading is a user comment. The `D = 4` diagonal cut is in print for its geometry, with no count and no sequence. What is new is the factorisation of the digit polynomial, the order `ceil(D/2)` and its exactness criterion, the product formula and the odd half, the even half at both bases, the Fourier form of the certificate vector and its telescoping, the frequency separation, the transient constant `log R / 4` and the three-value theorem with its per-`D` condition, the uniqueness of base `3`, and the tent rank law.

## The design, the census and the carry machine

Throughout, `q >= 3` is an odd integer, `m = (q-1)/2` its middle digit and `D >= 2` the dimension; `L` is the level and `f_D` the fill. All are fixed unless a statement says otherwise.

**Definition 2.1 (the design).** A digit vector `(d_1, ..., d_D)` in `{0, ..., q-1}^D` is admissible when at most one `d_i` equals `m`. The level-`L` solid is the set of cells of the `q^L`-refined `D`-dimensional grid all of whose `L` digit vectors are admissible. At `q = 3`, `D = 3` it is the Menger sponge.

**Definition 2.2 (digit polynomial and fill).** Let `A_q(t) = sum_(d != m) t^d` and `P_D(t) = A_q(t)^(D-1) (A_q(t) + D t^m)`, so that `P_D[s]` counts the admissible digit vectors of coordinate sum `s`. The fill is `f_D = P_D(1) = (q-1)^(D-1)(q-1+D)`. At `q = 3`

```
P_D(t) = (1 + t^2)^(D-1) (1 + Dt + t^2) ,    f_D = 2^(D-1)(D+2) ,    P_D[2k] = C(D, k) ,    P_D[2k+1] = D C(D-1, k) .
```

The factorisation is a two-line count: either no coordinate takes the middle digit, which contributes `A_q^D`, or exactly one of `D` does, which contributes `D t^m A_q^(D-1)`. At `q = 3` the even coefficients come from `(1 + t^2)^D` and the odd ones from `Dt(1 + t^2)^(D-1)`.

**Lemma 2.3 (palindromy and positivity).** `deg P_D = 2Dm` and `P_D[Dm + x] = P_D[Dm - x]` for every `x`; and `P_D[s] > 0` for every `0 <= s <= 2Dm`.

**Proof.** The digit set less `m` is symmetric about `m`, so `t^(q-1) A_q(1/t) = A_q(t)`, and since `q - 1 - m = m` also `t^(q-1)(A_q(1/t) + D t^(-m)) = A_q(t) + D t^m`; the product of the `D - 1` copies of the first relation with the second gives `t^(2Dm) P_D(1/t) = P_D(t)`. For positivity, every coefficient of `A_q + D t^m` on `{0, ..., q-1}` is at least `1`, and the support of `A_q^(D-1)` contains `0, q-1, ..., (D-1)(q-1)` because `0` and `q - 1` lie in the support of `A_q`. Given `s`, put `j = min(floor(s/(q-1)), D-1)`; then `0 <= s - j(q-1) <= q-1` and `P_D[s] >= A_q^(D-1)[j(q-1)] (A_q + D t^m)[s - j(q-1)] > 0`. □

**Definition 2.4 (the two censuses).** The central census `a_D(L)` counts the admissible level-`L` cells whose coordinate sum is the palindromic centre `Dm(q^L - 1)/(q - 1)`, the coordinate sum of the centre cell of the grid; the sheaf census `b_D(L)` counts those whose coordinate sum is congruent to it modulo `q^L`, the central hyperplane together with its `q^L`-translates. Both equal `1` at `L = 0`.

**Definition 2.5 (the carry matrix).** Read digits least significant first. A level-`L` history of digit-vector sums `(s_0, ..., s_(L-1))` lands in the sheaf census exactly when the carries `c_0 = 0`, `c_(j+1) = (c_j + Dm - s_j)/q` are all integers, and in the central census when moreover `c_L = 0`. Set

```
M = M^(D) ,    M[c', c] = P_D[c + Dm - q c'] ,
```

with row index the new carry and column index the old one, acting on column vectors by `u_(L+1) = M u_L`, `u_0 = e_0`. Then `u_L(c)` counts the level-`L` histories with terminal carry `c`, `a_D(L) = (M^L)[0, 0]` and `b_D(L) = 1^T M^L e_0`. The orientation is load-bearing: every sum of `M` below is a column sum.

The two identities behind the definition are one peel. A cell of the level-`L` solid is a choice of `L` admissible digit vectors, its coordinate sum is `sum_(j < L) q^j s_j` with `s_j` the digit sum at position `j`, and the number of admissible vectors with digit sum `s` is `P_D[s]`; so the number of cells with coordinate sum `T` is the coefficient of `t^T` in `prod_(j < L) P_D(t^(q^j))`. Since the centre `N_L = Dm(q^L - 1)/(q-1)` satisfies `N_L = q N_(L-1) + Dm`, peeling the lowest digit vector of sum `s` from the target `N_L + c` leaves the target `N_(L-1) + c'` with `c' = (c + Dm - s)/q`, admissible exactly when the division is exact. Congruence to `N_L` modulo `q^L` forces every partial congruence, because `N_L - N_p = q^p N_(L-p)`, so each history in the sheaf census is one integer carry path from `0`, with final carry `c_L` free; the central census is the paths that return to `0`.

**Lemma 2.6 (carry window and forward closure).** Every carry reachable from `0` satisfies `|c| <= floor((D-1)/2)`, and the state set `S = {c : |c| <= floor((D-1)/2)}` is forward closed: `M[c', c] != 0` with `c` in `S` forces `c'` in `S`. `M` denotes the restriction to `S` from here on; `n = ceil(D/2)` is the size of the even block defined next, at both parities.

**Proof.** `M[c', c] != 0` requires `0 <= c + Dm - qc' <= 2Dm`, that is `(c - Dm)/q <= c' <= (c + Dm)/q`. For `|c| <= (D-1)/2` this gives `|c'| <= ((D-1)/2 + Dm)/q = D/2 - 1/(2q) < D/2`, and the only integers of modulus below `D/2` are those of modulus at most `floor((D-1)/2)`. Reachability is the same computation started at `c_0 = 0`. □

**Lemma 2.7 (reflection and the even block).** `M[-c', -c] = M[c', c]`, so the carry reflection `R : c -> -c` commutes with `M`. The orbit of `e_0` lies in the `+1` eigenspace of `R`, of dimension `ceil(D/2)`, spanned by `e_0` and `e_k + e_(-k)` for `1 <= k <= floor((D-1)/2)`; the matrix of `M` on that eigenspace in that basis is the even block `M_even`, an `n x n` integer matrix with entries `M[c', 0]` in the column `c = 0` and `M[c', c] + M[c', -c]` for `c >= 1`. The matrix of `M` on the `-1` eigenspace, in the basis `e_k - e_(-k)`, is the odd block `M_odd`, with entries `M[c', c] - M[c', -c]`.

**Proof.** `M[-c', -c] = P_D[-c + Dm + qc'] = P_D[Dm - (c - qc')] = P_D[Dm + (c - qc')] = M[c', c]` by Lemma 2.3. `R` commutes with `M` and fixes `e_0`, so every `u_L` is reflection-even; the eigenspaces of `R` decompose the carry space into two `M`-invariant summands, and the two blocks are the matrices of the two restrictions in the stated bases. □

**Proposition 2.8 (the fold identity).** `det M = det M_even det M_odd`, an identity of integers with no sign and no power of `2`; in particular `v_2(det M_even) <= v_2(det M)`.

**Proof.** The change of basis from the standard basis of `R^S` to the basis `(e_0, e_1 + e_(-1), ..., e_1 - e_(-1), ...)` conjugates `M` to the block-diagonal matrix `diag(M_even, M_odd)`, since both eigenspaces are `M`-invariant by Lemma 2.7. Conjugation preserves the determinant, so `det M = det M_even det M_odd`; the determinant of the change of basis cancels identically and no bookkeeping of `2`-powers is needed. Only palindromy and the shift convention enter, so the argument runs at every odd `q` and both parities of `D`. □

**Proposition 2.9 (the core is primitive).** `M` on `S` is irreducible and aperiodic. Its Perron root is `rho_D = rho(M_even)`, and `rho(M_odd) < rho_D`.

**Proof.** `M[0, c] = P_D[c + Dm] > 0` for every `c` in `S` by Lemma 2.3, since `0 < c + Dm < 2Dm`; so every state reaches `0` in one step and `0` carries a self-loop. For `0 <= c <= floor((D-1)/2) - 1` one has `Dm - (q-1)c >= 3(q-1)/2 >= q`, so `0 <= c + Dm - q(c+1) <= 2Dm` and `M[c+1, c] > 0`: the carry climbs from `0` one step at a time to the window edge, the negative states follow by the reflection of Lemma 2.7, and `M` on `S` is irreducible with a self-loop, hence primitive. For the spectral statement, `M` has a nonnegative Perron eigenvector `v`; its even part `(v + Rv)/2` is nonnegative and nonzero (`Rv = -v` with both sides nonnegative forces `v = 0`), hence an eigenvector of `M_even` at `rho(M)`, so `rho(M_even) = rho(M) =: rho_D`; and by primitivity every other eigenvalue of `M` has modulus strictly below `rho_D`, so `rho(M_odd) < rho_D`. □

Proposition 2.9 is used only where a growth rate must be read off the census, in Theorem 4.1(iii) and Proposition 4.2. The certificate theorems of Section 4, and so Theorems 6.1 and 7.1, need none of it.

**Definition 2.10 (symbol and circle form).** Let `g_q(psi) = 2 sum_(j=1)^m cos(j psi) = sin(q psi/2)/sin(psi/2) - 1`, the Dirichlet kernel with the middle digit removed, and `Phi_D(psi) = g_q(psi)^(D-1) (D + g_q(psi))`. Both are real and even, `A_q(e^(i psi)) = e^(im psi) g_q(psi)` and `P_D(e^(i psi)) = e^(imD psi) Phi_D(psi)`. At `q = 3`, `g_3(psi) = 2 cos psi` and `Phi_D(psi) = (2 cos psi)^(D-1)(D + 2 cos psi)`.

**Lemma 2.11 (the root of unity, and where parity lives).** `g_q(2 pi t/q) = -1` for every `t` not divisible by `q`, hence `Phi_D(2 pi t/q) = (-1)^(D-1)(D-1)`.

**Proof.** `sum_(d=0)^(q-1) z^d = 0` for `z^q = 1`, `z != 1`; that sum is `z^m (1 + g_q)` and `z^m != 0`, so `g_q = -1`. □

This one value is the whole parity mechanism: the design symbol at a nontrivial `q`-th root of unity carries the factor `(-1)^(D-1)` that flips the sign law. The same filtering gives the column sums of `M` exactly.

**Proposition 2.12 (column sums and the mass identity).** For every `c` in `S`,

```
sum_(c') M[c', c] = ( f_D + (-1)^(D-1)(D-1)(q 1[q | c] - 1) ) / q ,
```

two values, `f_D/q + (-1)^(D-1)(D-1)(q-1)/q` on the carries divisible by `q` and `f_D/q - (-1)^(D-1)(D-1)/q` elsewhere, both positive. Let `w > 0` be the right Perron vector of `M` on `S` with `sum_c w_c = 1` and `p_D = sum_(q | c) w_c` its mass on the carries divisible by `q`. Then

```
q rho_D = f_D + (-1)^(D-1)(D-1)(q p_D - 1) ,
```

so the sign law at every dimension and both parities at once is the single parity-free inequality `p_D > 1/q`.

**Proof.** The column sum at `c` is `sum_(s = c + Dm mod q) P_D[s]`, which root-of-unity filtering with `omega = e^(2 pi i/q)` writes as `q^(-1) sum_t omega^(-t(c + Dm)) P_D(omega^t)`; the `t = 0` term is `f_D`, and by Definition 2.10 and Lemma 2.11 every other term is `(-1)^(D-1)(D-1) omega^(tmD)`, so the phases collapse to `omega^(-tc)` and `sum_(t != 0) omega^(-tc) = q 1[q | c] - 1`. Positivity: `f_D >= (q-1)^(D-1) (q - 1 + D) > (D-1)(q-1)` at every `q >= 3`, `D >= 2`. Contract the column-sum identity against `w`, using `1^T M w = rho_D` and `1^T w = 1`, to get the mass identity; the sign statement follows because `(-1)^(D-1)(D-1)` is positive at odd `D` and negative at even `D` while `q p_D - 1` does not depend on the parity. □

**Theorem 2.13 (the pinning).** For every `D >= 2`, `|rho_D - f_D/q| <= (D-1)(q-1)/q`; by parity, `rho_D` lies in `[f_D/q - (D-1)(q-1)/q, f_D/q + (D-1)/q]` at even `D` and in `[f_D/q - (D-1)/q, f_D/q + (D-1)(q-1)/q]` at odd `D`. At `q = 3` this is `|rho_D - f_D/3| <= 2(D-1)/3`. In particular `rho_D = (f_D/q)(1 + O(D^2 (q-1)^(-D)))` and

```
log_q rho_D - (log_q f_D - 1) -> 0 :
```

whatever the sign law does, the counting exponent of the slice converges to the generic value, and only the side of the approach is in question.

**Proof.** The spectral radius of a nonnegative matrix lies between its smallest and its largest column sum, and `rho(M) = rho_D` by Proposition 2.9. The two column sums of Proposition 2.12 read off the brackets by the parity of `(-1)^(D-1)`, and both brackets lie inside `|rho_D - f_D/q| <= (D-1)(q-1)/q`. Against `f_D/q >= (q-1)^(D-1)(D+2)/q` the error is relative `O(D^2 (q-1)^(-D))`, and `log_q` of `1 + O(D^2 (q-1)^(-D))` tends to `0`. □

## The recurrence of order ceil(D/2)

**Theorem 3.1 (the order).** At every odd base `q` and every `D >= 2` the central census `a_D(L)` satisfies the linear recurrence with constant integer coefficients given by `chi_D`, the characteristic polynomial of `M_even`; in particular it obeys a constant-coefficient linear recurrence of order at most `ceil(D/2)`.

**Proof.** By Definition 2.5, `a_D(L) = e_0^T M^L e_0`, and by Lemma 2.6 the orbit of `e_0` stays in the finite state set `S`. By Lemma 2.7 the vector `u_L = M^L e_0` lies for every `L` in the `+1` eigenspace `E` of the reflection, `E` is `M`-invariant, and the matrix of `M` on `E` is `M_even`, of size `n = ceil(D/2)`. Cayley-Hamilton gives `chi_D(M|_E) = 0`, so with `chi_D(x) = sum_(k=0)^n chi_(D,k) x^(n-k)`, `chi_(D,0) = 1`, the vector identity `sum_k chi_(D,k) u_(L+n-k) = chi_D(M|_E) u_L = 0` holds for every `L >= 0`; applying the coordinate functional `w -> w_0` gives `sum_k chi_(D,k) a_D(L+n-k) = 0`. The coefficients are integers because `M_even` has integer entries. □

Order `2D + 1` is free, from the untrimmed automaton on the states `-D, ..., D`; the sharpening is the contraction of Lemma 2.6 and the reflection of Lemma 2.7, roughly a factor of four uniformly in `D`. The upper bound is exact when, and only when, one determinant is nonzero.

**Theorem 3.2 (the criterion).** Let `n = ceil(D/2)` and `H_D = det(a_D(i+j))`, `0 <= i, j < n`. The minimal order of a recurrence satisfied by `a_D(0), a_D(1), ...` is exactly `n` if and only if `H_D != 0`; the minimal order of a recurrence satisfied from level `1` on, by `a_D(1), a_D(2), ...`, is exactly `n` if and only if `H_D det M_even != 0`. Distinct eigenvalues of `M_even` do not suffice for either.

**Proof.** Write `K = [e_0, M e_0, ..., M^(n-1) e_0]` and `K' = [e_0, M^T e_0, ..., (M^T)^(n-1) e_0]` on `E`, so that `H_D = K'^T K` and `det(a_D(i+j+1)) = det(K'^T M K) = H_D det M_even`. If `H_D != 0`, both Krylov matrices are invertible; a recurrence of order `r < n` with monic polynomial `p` gives `e_0^T M^L p(M) e_0 = 0` for every `L`, so the vector `p(M) e_0` is orthogonal to the full left Krylov space, hence zero, and `e_0, ..., M^r e_0` are dependent, against the invertibility of `K`. If `H_D = 0`, take `y != 0` with `H_D y = 0` and `x = K y`; then `e_0^T M^i x = 0` for `i < n`, the sequence `e_0^T M^L x` obeys the order-`n` recurrence of Theorem 3.1 and starts with `n` zeros, so it vanishes identically, and `sum_j y_j a_D(L + j) = 0` for every `L` is a recurrence of order below `n`. From level `1` the same argument runs on `K'^T M K`. For the last sentence, `M = diag(1, 2)` with start vector `e_0` has distinct eigenvalues while `e_0^T M^L e_0 = 1` has order `1`: distinct eigenvalues make `M_even` non-derogatory, which gives some cyclic vector and not that `e_0` is one. □

**Theorem 3.3 (exactness on a box).** The order is exactly `ceil(D/2)`, from level `0` and from level `1`, at base `3` for every `2 <= D <= 14`, at every odd base `3 <= q <= 25` for every `2 <= D <= 14`, and at every odd base for every `2 <= D <= 10`.

**Proof.** By Theorem 3.2 it is enough that `H_D` and `det M_even` are nonzero. On the box `q = 3, ..., 25`, `D = 2, ..., 14` both are exact nonzero integers, `156` cases. At `D = 3, 4` and any odd `q`, with `g = Dm`, `H_D = a_D(2) - a_D(1)^2 = M_even[0,1] M_even[1,0] = (P_D[g - q] + P_D[g + q]) P_D[g + 1] > 0` by Lemma 2.3, every index inside `[0, 2g]`. For `2 <= D <= 10` at every odd base, every entry of `M_even` is a polynomial in `n' = (q+1)/2` within each class of `q mod 4`, by inclusion-exclusion on `((1 - x^n')/(1 - x))^D` and `(1 - x^n')^(D-1)(1 - x^(n'-1))/(1 - x)^D`, each term kept or dropped by a threshold computed term by term and equal to `n' = 2` in every case; so `H_D` and `det M_even` are polynomials in `n'`, of degree up to `168`, the Fujiwara bound puts every real root below `n' = 67`, and every odd base below the bound is checked directly in integers, entry by entry, with no zero anywhere. Generator: `spectra/lab/py/spectra-from-cuts`, verb `order`. □

Exactness for every `D` is Conjecture R of the Open problems: one lemma, `H_D det M_even != 0` at every `D`, with the base taken out of it by the polynomial form.

**Proposition 3.4 (off-centre slices).** Fix an integer offset `k` with `|k| <= floor((D-1)/2)` and let `a_D(L; k)` count the cells of the level-`L` solid on the parallel hyperplane at coordinate sum `Dm(q^L - 1)/(q-1) + k`. Then `a_D(L; k) = e_0^T M^L e_k`, `a_D(L; k) = a_D(L; -k)` for every `L`, and `a_D(.; k)` satisfies the recurrence given by `chi_D`.

**Proof.** The peel of Definition 2.5 with the target `N_L + k` gives `a_D(L; k) = e_k^T (M^T)^L e_0 = e_0^T M^L e_k`. Since `R` is symmetric, commutes with `M` and fixes `e_0`, `a_D(L; -k) = e_0^T M^L R e_k = (R e_0)^T M^L e_k = a_D(L; k)`. Hence `a_D(L; k) = e_0^T M^L w` with `w = (e_k + e_(-k))/2`, which lies in `E` because `|k| <= floor((D-1)/2)` puts `e_k` in the core; Cayley-Hamilton on `M|_E` finishes as in Theorem 3.1. □

The hypothesis is sharp at even `D`: at `D = 4` the offset `k = 2 = D/2` sits on the fixed point of the carry map, never enters the core, and `chi_4` applied to `a_4(.; 2)` leaves the constant residual `128`.

**Lemma 3.5 (the trace at base 3).** At `q = 3`, `tr M_even = 3D 2^(D-3)` for odd `D` and `3 2^(D-2) - 1` for even `D`: `2, 9, 11, 60, 47, 336` at `D = 2, ..., 7`.

**Proof.** With `r = floor((D-1)/2)` the diagonal of `M_even` reads `P_D[D]` and `P_D[D - 2c] + P_D[D - 4c]` for `1 <= c <= r`. By palindromy `P_D[D - 2c] = P_D[D + 2c]`, so `P_D[D] + sum_(c=1)^r P_D[D - 2c] = (P_D[D] + sum_(|c| <= r) P_D[D - 2c])/2`. At odd `D` the indices `D - 2c`, `|c| <= r`, are all the odd ones, whose coefficients sum to `(P_D(1) - P_D(-1))/2 = D 2^(D-1)`, and `P_D[D] = D C(D-1, (D-1)/2)`; the indices `D - 4c`, `1 <= c <= r`, that lie in range are the odd `s < D` with `s = D mod 4`, that is `P_D[2k+1] = D C(D-1, k)` over `k < (D-1)/2` with `k = (D-1)/2 mod 2`, and since `k -> D - 1 - k` preserves that class and `sum_(k = a mod 2) C(D-1, k) = 2^(D-2)`, their sum is `D (2^(D-2) - C(D-1, (D-1)/2))/2`. Adding, `tr M_even = D 2^(D-1)/2 + D 2^(D-2)/2 = 3D 2^(D-3)`. At even `D` the indices `D - 2c`, `|c| <= r`, are the even ones other than `0` and `2D`, with coefficient sum `(P_D(1) + P_D(-1))/2 - 2 = 2^D - 2`, `P_D[D] = C(D, D/2)`, and the in-range `D - 4c` are the even `s < D` with `s = D mod 4`, `P_D[2k] = C(D, k)` over `k < D/2`, `k = D/2 mod 2`, summing to `(2^(D-1) - C(D, D/2))/2`; adding gives `(2^D - 2)/2 + 2^(D-1)/2 = 3 2^(D-2) - 1`. □

**Corollary 3.6 (the growth rate).** `a_D(L)^(1/L) -> rho_D`, and `rho_D` is an algebraic integer of degree at most `ceil(D/2)`, the dominant root of `chi_D`. Whenever the counting exponent `lim_L log_q a_D(L)/L` of the slice is defined, it is `log_q rho_D`.

**Proof.** `M` on `S` is primitive by Proposition 2.9, so `(M^L)[0, 0] = a_D(L)` grows like a positive constant times `rho_D^L`, and `rho_D = rho(M_even)` is a root of the monic integer polynomial `chi_D` of degree `n`. □

**Fact 3.7 (the anchors).** At `D = 3`, base `3`, the machine returns `M_even = [[6, 6], [1, 3]]`, trace `9`, determinant `12`, `chi_3 = x^2 - 9x + 12`, Perron root `(9 + sqrt 33)/2 = 7.372281` and census `1, 6, 42, 306, 2250, 16578, 122202`, exactly the signature `(9, -12)` and the terms of A299916 up to an index shift, by a route that never mentions a hexagon; `log_3 rho_3 = 1.818410` against the generic `log_3 20 - 1 = 1.726833`. At `D = 2` the census is `2^L`, of order `1`. At `D = 4`, `chi_4 = x^2 - 11x - 66`, `rho_4 = (11 + sqrt 385)/2 = 15.310708` against `f_4/3 = 16`, census `1, 6, 132, 1848, 29040, 441408, 6772128`; at `D = 5` and `D = 6` the censuses begin `1, 30, 1000, 35700, 1321600, 49786200` and `1, 20, 4030, 242300, 24642700`, both of order `3`. The level-`1` slice is the vertex set of the cube's central cross-section, a hypersimplex: `a_D(1) = P_D[D]` reads `2, 6, 6, 30, 20, 140, 70` at `D = 2, ..., 8`, `C(D, D/2)` at even `D` and `D C(D-1, (D-1)/2)` at odd `D`, matched against a brute-force enumeration of all `3^D` digit vectors at `2 <= D <= 14`. In all `156` cases of the box of Theorem 3.3 the characteristic polynomial of `M_even` is square-free with every root real, which nothing here proves. Generators: `cuts/lab/py/slice-ladder-controls` for the hypersimplex counts and the `D = 4` ladder, `spectra/lab/py/spectra-from-cuts` verb `order` for the `D = 5, 6` ladders and the spectrum of the box, and `spectra/lab/py/spectra-from-cuts` verb `block` for the `D = 3` block at every odd base.

## The reduction and the two certificate machines

This section reduces the sign law to one integer sequence and gives two finite tests, either of which settles a single dimension outright. Write `hat u_L(psi) = sum_c u_L(c) e^(ic psi)`, `m_0(L) = sum_(q | c) u_L(c)` for the census mass on the carries divisible by `q`, and

```
V(L) = q m_0(L) - b_D(L) ,    W_k = q^(k-1) ( q b_D(k) - f_D b_D(k-1) ) .
```

**Theorem 4.1 (the reduction chain).** Let `q >= 3` be odd and `D >= 2`. (i) For every `L >= 0` and every real `psi`, with `y_r = (psi + 2 pi r)/q`,

```
hat u_(L+1)(psi) = (1/q) sum_(r=0)^(q-1) Phi_D(y_r) hat u_L(y_r) .
```

(ii) For every `k >= 1`, `W_k = (-1)^(D-1)(D-1) q^(k-1) V(k-1)`; in particular at even `D`, `q b_D(L+1) - f_D b_D(L) = -(D-1) V(L)`. (iii) If `D` is even and `V(L) >= 0` for every `L >= L_1`, then `rho_D <= f_D/q`.

**Proof.** (i) By Definition 2.5, `hat u_(L+1)(psi) = sum_(c') e^(ic' psi) sum_c P_D[c + Dm - qc'] u_L(c)`. Insert the indicator `1[q | N] = q^(-1) sum_(r < q) e^(2 pi i rN/q)` with `N = c + Dm - s` and reindex the inner sum by `s`, so that `c' = N/q` and `c' psi + 2 pi rN/q = N y_r`; the two exponentials merge into `e^(iN y_r)`, and summing over `s` gives `hat u_(L+1)(psi) = q^(-1) sum_r hat u_L(y_r) e^(iDm y_r) P_D(e^(-i y_r))`. By Definition 2.10 with `psi -> -y_r` and evenness of `Phi_D`, `e^(iDm y_r) P_D(e^(-i y_r)) = Phi_D(y_r)`, and every phase is gone. The cancellation is exact, not asymptotic: the symbol carries the phase `e^(imD psi)` because `P_D` is palindromic about `Dm`, and the carry rule carries the offset `Dm` because the census target is the palindromic centre; these are the same `Dm`. Move the target off centre and the recursion still closes, but no longer on real even data.

(ii) Put `psi = 0` in (i): `y_r = 2 pi r/q` and `b_D(L+1) = hat u_(L+1)(0)`. The `r = 0` term is `f_D b_D(L)/q`; for `r != 0`, Lemma 2.11 makes `Phi_D(2 pi r/q)` the constant `(-1)^(D-1)(D-1)`, and `sum_(r != 0) hat u_L(2 pi r/q) = sum_c u_L(c)(q 1[q | c] - 1) = V(L)`. So `q b_D(L+1) - f_D b_D(L) = (-1)^(D-1)(D-1) V(L)`; multiply by `q^(k-1)` at `L = k - 1`.

(iii) At even `D`, (ii) and `V(L) >= 0` give `b_D(L+1) <= (f_D/q) b_D(L)` for `L >= L_1`, so `b_D(L) <= C (f_D/q)^L`. By Proposition 2.9 the core is primitive, so `b_D(L)^(1/L) = (1^T M^L e_0)^(1/L) -> rho_D`, whence `rho_D <= f_D/q`. □

At odd `D` the exponent `D - 1` is even, `Phi_D >= 0` pointwise, and every `W_k >= 0` term by term: that is the whole odd half, Section 5. At even `D` the sign of `Phi_D` follows the sign of `g_q`, and the needed inequality is false pointwise: at `q = 3`, `k = 2`, the quantity `W_2/((-1)^(D-1)(D-1)) = 3 V(1) = 2[Phi_D(2 pi/9) + Phi_D(4 pi/9) + Phi_D(8 pi/9)]` is negative for every even `D >= 6`, because `Phi_D(8 pi/9) = -(2 cos(pi/9))^(D-1)(D - 2 cos(pi/9))` outweighs the two positive terms. No pointwise or magnitude-only certificate can work at even `D`; and no finite sign table of the `W_k` can decide it either, since `b_D(L) ~ C rho_D^L` forces `W_L ~ C q^(L-1) rho_D^(L-1)(q rho_D - f_D)`, so the eventual sign of `W_k` is the assertion `rho_D < f_D/q` itself.

**Proposition 4.2 (the odd half, non-strict, at any odd base).** Let `q >= 3` be odd and let `D >= 3` be odd with `D + g_q(psi) > 0` for every real `psi`. Then `rho_D >= f_D/q`. The hypothesis holds for every odd `D >= q`, since `g_q >= -2m = -(q-1)`; at `q = 3` for every odd `D >= 3`, since `g_3 >= -2`; and at `q = 5` for every odd `D >= 3`, since `g_5(psi) = 4 cos^2 psi + 2 cos psi - 2 >= -9/4`, the minimum at `cos psi = -1/4`.

**Proof.** At odd `D`, `g_q^(D-1) >= 0`, so `Phi_D = g_q^(D-1)(D + g_q) >= 0` pointwise. Now `hat u_0 = 1 >= 0`, and Theorem 4.1(i) writes `hat u_(L+1)(psi)` as a nonnegative combination of values of `hat u_L`, so `hat u_L >= 0` on all of `R` for every `L` by induction. In particular `V(L) = sum_(r != 0) hat u_L(2 pi r/q) >= 0`, and at odd `D` the identity of Theorem 4.1(ii) reads `q b_D(L+1) - f_D b_D(L) = (D-1) V(L) >= 0`, so `b_D(L) >= (f_D/q)^L` for every `L` and `b_D(L)^(1/L) -> rho_D` by Proposition 2.9. □

**Theorem 4.3 (the row certificate).** Fix `D` and let `v_c = q 1[q | c] - 1`, so that `V(L) = v^T u_L`. Suppose some integer `t >= 1` has `(v^T M^t)_j >= 0` for every `j` in `S` and `V(L) >= 0` for `L = 0, ..., t-1`. Then `V(L) >= 0` for every `L >= 0`; hence, at even `D`, `rho_D <= f_D/q` by Theorem 4.1(iii). If `(v^T M^t)_j > 0` for every `j`, then `V(L) > 0` for every `L >= t`.

**Proof.** For `L >= t`, `V(L) = v^T M^t u_(L-t) = sum_j (v^T M^t)_j u_(L-t)(j)`, and `u_(L-t) >= 0` entrywise because `u_0 = e_0 >= 0` and `M >= 0`; both factors are nonnegative, so the sum is, and it is positive when the row is positive entrywise because `u_(L-t)` is nonzero. For `L < t` the hypothesis is the prefix check. □

The row certificate is one matrix power and one sign scan, but it proves only `rho_D <= f_D/q`, and turning `<=` into `<` then costs a determinant argument with an exceptional residue class (Section 5). The second machine gives strictness for free.

**Theorem 4.4 (the column certificate, Collatz-Wielandt).** Let `beta_K = (M^T)^K 1`, that is `beta_K(c) = sum_(c') (M^K)[c', c]`, the number of level-`K` histories started at carry `c`, with `beta_0 = 1`. Then `beta_K > 0` on `S` for every `K >= 0`, and if for some `K >= 0`

```
q beta_(K+1)(c) < f_D beta_K(c)    for every c in S ,
```

then `rho_D < f_D/q` strictly. Moreover `f_D beta_K - q beta_(K+1) = (-1)^D (D-1) (M^T)^K v`, so the test at depth `K` holds exactly when the row `v^T M^K` of Theorem 4.3 is positive entrywise (even `D`) or negative entrywise (odd `D`).

**Proof.** Positivity: the column sums of Proposition 2.12 are positive, so every carry in `S` has an admissible successor, and the column sums of `M^K` are positive. For the criterion, the strict Collatz-Wielandt bound: if `B >= 0` and `x > 0` satisfy `Bx < theta x` entrywise, then `theta' = max_i (Bx)_i/x_i < theta` gives `B^k x <= theta'^k x`, so every entry of `B^k` is at most `theta'^k max(x)/min(x)` and `rho(B) <= theta' < theta`. Apply it with `B = M^T`, `x = beta_K`, `theta = f_D/q`, using `M^T beta_K = beta_(K+1)` and `rho(M^T) = rho_D`; no irreducibility is needed. For the last identity, Proposition 2.12 says `f_D 1 - q M^T 1 = (-1)^D (D-1) v` entrywise, since `(-1)^(D-1)(D-1)(q 1[q | c] - 1) = (-1)^(D-1)(D-1) v_c`; apply `(M^T)^K`. □

Two features matter for everything that follows: the test does not care where its positive vector came from, and any `K` at which it passes is a proof. `K = 0` never works for `D > 1`: the test reads `f_D + (-1)^(D-1)(D-1)(1 - q 1[q | c]) < f_D`, which at even `D` fails at every `c` not divisible by `q`. The all-ones vector is off by exactly the `D - 1` of Lemma 2.11, and the certificate must smooth it away; Sections 6 and 7 construct a depth `K` at which `beta_K` passes, at bases `5` and `3`.

## The odd half and strictness

**Theorem 5.1 (the product formula at base 3).** At `q = 3`, for every `D >= 2` and `L >= 0`,

```
b_D(L) = sum_(c in S) (M^L)[c, 0] = 3^(-L) sum_(m=0)^(3^L - 1) prod_(j=0)^(L-1) Phi_D( 2 pi m 3^j / 3^L ) ,
```

a sum of `3^L` products of cosines that is a positive integer. Sorting `m` by its `3`-adic valuation, with `U_k = {1 <= u < 3^k : 3 does not divide u}` and `W_k = sum_(u in U_k) prod_(j<k) Phi_D(2 pi u 3^j/3^k)`, `W_0 = 1`,

```
3^L b_D(L) = sum_(k=0)^L f_D^(L-k) W_k ,    3 b_D(k) - f_D b_D(k-1) = 3^(1-k) W_k ,
```

and the innermost factor of every product in `W_k` is `Phi_D(2 pi u/3) = (-1)^(D-1)(D-1)`, so `W_k = (-1)^(D-1)(D-1) 3^(k-1) V(k-1)` with `V` as in Section 4.

**Proof.** The first equality is Definition 2.5: the sheaf census is the number of carry paths from `0` with free end. For the second, the coordinate sums `T = N_L mod 3^L` are extracted by the discrete Fourier filter: with `zeta = e^(2 pi i/3^L)`, `b_D(L) = 3^(-L) sum_m zeta^(-N_L m) prod_(j<L) P_D(zeta^(m 3^j))`. By Definition 2.10, `P_D(zeta^(m 3^j)) = e^(iD psi_j) Phi_D(psi_j)` with `psi_j = 2 pi m 3^j/3^L`, and `prod_j e^(iD psi_j) = exp(2 pi i m D (3^L - 1)/(2 3^L)) = zeta^(m N_L)`, which cancels the extraction phase exactly and leaves the real sum. It is a positive integer because it is a census and `b_D(L) >= a_D(L) >= P_D[D]^L >= 1`. For the sorting, `m = 0` contributes `Phi_D(0)^L = f_D^L`, and `m = 3^(L-k) u` with `u` in `U_k` has factors `Phi_D(0) = f_D` at `j >= k` and `prod_(j<k) Phi_D(2 pi u 3^j/3^k)` below, so `3^L b_D(L) = sum_k f_D^(L-k) W_k`; subtract `f_D` times the identity at `L - 1`. The innermost factor has angle `2 pi u/3`, and Lemma 2.11 gives its value; what remains of `W_k` after that factor is `sum_(u in U_k) prod_(j<k-1) Phi_D(2 pi u 3^j/3^k)`, which is `3^(k-1) V(k-1)` by Theorem 4.1(ii) compared with the second display. □

Proposition 6.2 below is the same formula at every odd base, read at the carry `c = 0`.

**Theorem 5.2 (the odd half).** At `q = 3`, for every odd `D >= 3`, `rho_D >= f_D/3`, and if moreover `D` is not `1 mod 3` the inequality is strict.

**Proof.** At odd `D` the exponent `D - 1` is even, so `Phi_D >= 0` everywhere and every `W_k >= 0`; Theorem 5.1 gives `3^L b_D(L) >= f_D^L`, that is `b_D(L) >= (f_D/3)^L` for every `L`. Since `b_D(L)` is the `0`-column sum of `M^L`, `b_D(L) <= ||M^L||_1`, and Gelfand's formula gives `rho(M) >= limsup b_D(L)^(1/L) >= f_D/3`; `rho(M) = rho_D` by Proposition 2.9. For strictness, the matrix `J = f_D I - 3 M_even` has integer entries and `chi_D(f_D/3) = 3^(-n) det J`; modulo `3` the term `3 M_even` vanishes, so `det J = f_D^n mod 3`, and `3 | f_D = 2^(D-1)(D+2)` exactly when `D = 1 mod 3`. Off that class `det J != 0`, `f_D/3` is not an eigenvalue, and `rho_D >= f_D/3` forces `rho_D > f_D/3`. □

The remaining content of the sign law is one word, strictly, and it is a question about divisibility, not size. Put `Delta_D = det(f_D I - q M_even)`, an integer; `rho_D = f_D/q` is possible only when `Delta_D = 0`.

**Theorem 5.3 (the mod-p reduction).** Let `q` be an odd base, `D >= 2`, and `p` any integer dividing `q`. Then `Delta_D = f_D^n mod p`, `n = ceil(D/2)`. In particular, if `p` does not divide `f_D` then `Delta_D != 0` and `rho_D != f_D/q`. At base `3` this is every `D` not `1 mod 3`; at base `5`, where `f_D = 4^(D-1)(D+4)`, every `D` not `1 mod 5`.

**Proof.** Every entry of `q M_even` is divisible by `q` and hence by `p`, so `f_D I - q M_even = f_D I mod p` entrywise and `Delta_D = det(f_D I) = f_D^n mod p`. Primality of `p` is never used. □

Inside the exceptional class `p = q` says nothing, since `f_D^n = 0 mod q`. The base is odd, so `2` is coprime to it, and the `2`-adic valuation sees the two ends of the determinant expansion separately.

**Theorem 5.4 (the 2-adic reduction).** Let `q` be an odd base and `D >= 2`. If `v_2(det M_even) < v_2(f_D)`, then `Delta_D != 0`; indeed `v_2(Delta_D) = v_2(det M_even)`. The thresholds are `v_2(f_D) = D - 1 + v_2(D+2)` at base `3`, so `D - 1` at odd `D`, and `2(D-1) + v_2(D+4)` at base `5`.

**Proof.** Expanding the pencil, `Delta_D = sum_(k=0)^n f_D^(n-k) (-q)^k e_k(M_even)`, with `e_k` the sum of the `k x k` principal minors, every `e_k` an integer and `e_n = det M_even`. Since `q` is odd, `v_2((-q)^k e_k) = v_2(e_k)`; the `k = n` term has valuation exactly `v_2(det M_even)`, and every other term carries a factor `f_D^(n-k)` with `n - k >= 1`, hence has valuation at least `v_2(f_D)`. Under the hypothesis the `k = n` term is the unique term of minimal valuation, so the sum is nonzero with that valuation. □

The two silent classes of Theorems 5.3 and 5.4, `p | q` against `p | f_D`, are complementary, and both exceptional classes of the sign law reduce to one uniform question: how large can `v_2(det M_even)` get. Section 9 proves the first layer of that valuation; the computed record is this.

**Fact 5.5 (strictness on a range).** At base `3` and odd `D = 1 mod 3`, `v_2(det M_even) < D - 1` at every `D = 13, 19, ..., 241`, and at `D = 7` the route is silent (`v_2(det M_even) = 7 >= 6`) while `Delta_7 != 0` by direct evaluation; with Theorem 5.2 and Theorem 5.4, `rho_D > f_D/3` strictly at every odd `D <= 241`. The exact integer `Delta_D` is nonzero at every `D <= 80` in the class, three determinant algorithms agreeing. The stronger `v_2(det M_even) <= n = (D+1)/2` holds at every odd `D = 13, ..., 241` in the class and fails only at `D = 7`, and over all odd `5 <= D <= 39` it fails exactly at `D = 5, 7` with equality exactly at `D = 9, 15`. At base `5`, `v_2(det M_even) <= 26` out to `D = 156` against the threshold `2(D-1) + v_2(D+4)`, so `Delta_D != 0` at every `D <= 156`, the class `D = 1 mod 5` included. Generators: `cuts/lab/py/even-block-valuations` verb `selftest` for `v_2(det M_even) = 7` at `D = 7` and the `v_2 <= n` rows at odd `5 <= D <= 39`; `spectra/lab/py/smith-cascade` for the `v_2` rows to `511`; the base-`5` rows and the exact `Delta_D` to `80` are the shelf papers' certificates named in the Reproducibility section.

**Fact 5.6 (the computed sign law and the closing gap).** At base `3`, `sgn(rho_D - f_D/3) = (-1)^(D+1)` for every `2 <= D <= 100`, at `180` to `210` digits for `D <= 50` by two generators sharing no code and at `320` digits for `D <= 100`, and in exact rational arithmetic through `sgn Delta_D = (-1)^D` for `2 <= D <= 40`; at base `5` the sign alternates for `2 <= D <= 15`. There is no uniform spectral gap: with `lambda_2` the second eigenvalue of `M_even` in modulus, `lambda_1/|lambda_2| = (D+2)/(D-2) + O(D^(-3)) -> 1`, reading `13/12` to `2.58e-22` at `D = 50`, `1.068966` at `D = 60` and `1.04081632653` at `D = 100`, with `lambda_1 ~ f_D/3` and `|lambda_2| ~ |P_D(-1)|/3 = 2^(D-1)(D-2)/3`, every eigenvalue numerically real over `2 <= D <= 60`; so any proof of spectral separation must be uniform in a margin of order `4/D`, and the census route of Theorem 5.2, which never mentions `lambda_2`, is how the odd half fell. At small `D` the asymptote must not be quoted: `D = 4` has `lambda_2 = -4.310708` against `-16/3`. Generator: the shelf papers' verification scripts, named in the Reproducibility section; the `D = 3, 4` rungs are Fact 3.7.

## Base 5: the even half entire

**Theorem 6.1 (the even half at base 5).** On the base-`5` middle-digit design, `rho_D < f_D/5` for every even `D >= 2`, `f_D = 4^(D-1)(D+4)`; equivalently the slice exponent lies strictly below `log_5 f_D - 1` in every even dimension.

The proof occupies the section. Standing notation: `D` is even, `S = {|c| <= (D-2)/2}`, and `beta_K` is as in Theorem 4.4, extended to all integers `c` by the same formula; the extension is harmless because `S` is forward closed, so the restricted and unrestricted towers agree on `S`. The first two propositions hold at every odd base.

**Proposition 6.2 (Fourier form).** At every odd `q` and every `K >= 0`, `beta_K` is `q^K`-periodic and

```
beta_K(c) = q^(-K) sum_(n mod q^K) F_K(n) e^(2 pi i nc/q^K) ,    F_K(n) = prod_(i=1)^K Phi_D(2 pi n/q^i) .
```

**Proof.** Induction on `K`, `K = 0` being `beta_0 = 1`. Given the formula at `K`, `beta_(K+1)(c) = sum_(c') M[c', c] beta_K(c')`; insert the indicator `1[q | N] = q^(-1) sum_(r<q) e^(2 pi i rN/q)` with `N = c + Dm - s` before substituting the inductive hypothesis, and write `theta = 2 pi (n + r q^K)/q^(K+1)`. The two exponentials merge, and the inner sum over `s` is `e^(i(c + Dm) theta) P_D(e^(-i theta)) = e^(ic theta) Phi_D(theta)` by Definition 2.10, the same identical cancellation as in Theorem 4.1(i), now iterated. As `(n, r)` runs over `Z/q^K x Z/q`, `N' = n + r q^K` runs over `Z/q^(K+1)` once, and `Phi_D(2 pi N'/q^i) = Phi_D(2 pi n/q^i)` for `i <= K`, so `F_K(n) Phi_D(theta) = F_(K+1)(N')`. □

**Proposition 6.3 (exact telescoping).** At every odd `q`, even `D` and `K >= 0`,

```
f_D beta_K(c) - q beta_(K+1)(c) = q^(-K) (D-1) Sigma_K(c) ,    Sigma_K(c) = sum_(n mod q^(K+1), q does not divide n) T_K(n) e^(2 pi i nc/q^(K+1)) ,
```

with `T_K(n) = prod_(i=2)^(K+1) Phi_D(2 pi n/q^i)`; `Sigma_K` is real, `q^(K+1)`-periodic in `c`, and equals `2 sum_(1 <= n < q^(K+1)/2, q does not divide n) T_K(n) cos(2 pi nc/q^(K+1))`. Consequently the depth-`K` hypothesis of Theorem 4.4 is equivalent to

```
(C_K)    Sigma_K(c) > 0    for every |c| <= (D-2)/2 .
```

**Proof.** Split the sum of Proposition 6.2 at level `K + 1` by divisibility. For `n = q n'`, `F_(K+1)(q n') = Phi_D(2 pi n') F_K(n') = f_D F_K(n')` and the exponential is `e^(2 pi i n'c/q^K)`, so that block of `beta_(K+1)` is exactly `(f_D/q) beta_K`: an identity, not an estimate, and the whole leading-order cancellation. For `q` not dividing `n`, Lemma 2.11 gives `Phi_D(2 pi n/q) = -(D-1)` at even `D`, so `F_(K+1)(n) = -(D-1) T_K(n)`; two minus signs give the stated sign. Reality is evenness of `Phi_D` and the paired form is `n <-> q^(K+1) - n`. □

Now `q = 5`, `g_5(psi) = 4 cos^2 psi + 2 cos psi - 2`. The frequency `n = +-1` leads, and the next lemma says by how much, uniformly in `K`. Write `hat g_i = g_5(2 pi/5^i)` and `Q_K(n) = prod_(i=2)^(K+1) |g_5(2 pi n/5^i)|`, so `|T_K(n)| = Q_K(n)^(D-1) prod_i |D + g_5(2 pi n/5^i)|`; `T_K(1) > 0` because every angle `2 pi/5^i`, `i >= 2`, lies in `(0, pi/2)`.

**Lemma 6.4 (frequency separation).** For every `K >= 1` and every `n mod 5^(K+1)` with `5` not dividing `n` and `n` not `+-1`, `Q_K(n)/Q_K(1) <= r := 0.768`.

**Proof.** Let `j = min{i >= 2 : n is not +-1 mod 5^i}`, finite by hypothesis. For `i < j`, `n = epsilon mod 5^i` with one sign `epsilon`, consistent across levels since `5^(i-1) > 2`, so `|g_5(2 pi n/5^i)| = hat g_i` exactly and those factors contribute `1`. For `i > j` use `|g_5| <= 4`, so their total contribution is at most `C_j = prod_(i>j) 4/hat g_i`, which converges: `g_5(x) >= 4 - 5x^2` gives `4/hat g_i <= (1 - a 25^(-i))^(-1)` with `a = (5/4)(2 pi)^2`, and `prod (1 - x_i)^(-1) <= (1 - sum x_i)^(-1)`; in interval arithmetic `C_2 <= 1.0033008` and `C_3 <= 1.0001317`. Two branches remain. At `j = 2`, the eighteen residues `n mod 25` with `5` not dividing `n`, `n` not `+-1`, have `|g_5(2 pi n/25)| <= 2.8242670`, attained at `n = +-2`, against `hat g_2 >= 3.6897796`; the ratio is at most `0.7654303`, times `C_2` at most `0.7679580`. At `j >= 3`, `n = epsilon + t 5^(j-1) mod 5^j` with `t` in `{1, 2, 3, 4}`, so `2 pi n/5^j = 2 pi t/5 +- 2 pi/5^j`, exactly one grid unit from a point where `g_5 = -1` by Lemma 2.11; `|g_5'| <= 6` gives `|g_5(2 pi n/5^j)| <= 1 + 12 pi/5^j`, which against `hat g_j >= 4 - 5(2 pi/5^j)^2` and times `C_j` is at most `0.3264722` at `j = 3` and `0.2651481` for `j >= 4`. The maximum is `0.7679580 < 0.768`. □

Every numerical constant in that proof, in Proposition 6.5 and in Lemmas 7.4 to 7.6 is a rigorous rational-interval evaluation with outward rounding, carried by the certification named in the Reproducibility section; nothing rests on a floating-point evaluation. The bound is within `1.3%` of the truth: the exact maxima are `0.75818`, `0.75789`, `0.75788` at `K = 2, 3, 4`, all at `n = +-2`.

**Proposition 6.5 (the criterion).** Let `D >= 6` be even, `K >= 1`, and `kappa(D, K) = ((D+4)/(D + hat g_2)) ((D+4)/(D + hat g_3))^(K-1)`. If

```
(2 5^K - 1) r^(D-1) kappa(D, K) < cos( pi (D-2)/5^(K+1) )    and    5^(K+1) >= 4(D-2) ,
```

then `(C_K)` holds, hence `rho_D < f_D/5`.

**Proof.** The window condition and `|c| <= (D-2)/2` give `|2 pi c/5^(K+1)| <= pi(D-2)/5^(K+1) <= pi/4`, so the `n = +-1` term of `Sigma_K(c)` is at least `2 T_K(1) cos(pi(D-2)/5^(K+1)) > 0`. Of the `(5^(K+1) - 1)/2` integers in `[1, 5^(K+1)/2)`, `(5^(K+1) - 5)/10` are multiples of `5`, leaving `2 5^K`, and excluding `n = 1` leaves `2 5^K - 1`. For each, `|T_K(n)|/T_K(1) = (Q_K(n)/Q_K(1))^(D-1) prod_(i=2)^(K+1) |D + g_5(2 pi n/5^i)|/(D + hat g_i)`; in the second product the factors with `i < j` are exactly `1`, since the `g`-values themselves agree there, and the remaining at most `K` factors are each at most `(D+4)/(D + hat g_i) <= (D+4)/(D + hat g_3)` for `i >= 3`, the largest admissible shape being `kappa(D, K)`; `D + g_5 >= D - 4 > 0` needs `D >= 6`. Combine with Lemma 6.4 and the triangle inequality. □

**Proof of Theorem 6.1.** Take `K(D) = min{K >= 1 : 5^(K+1) >= 4(D-2)}` and split. Even `18 <= D <= 32`: `K(D) = 2` and the criterion of Proposition 6.5 is checked directly with certified interval constants, the left sides `0.5594, 0.3296, 0.1942, 0.1144, 0.0674, 0.0398, 0.0234, 0.0138` against the right sides `0.9202, 0.8994, 0.8763, 0.8510, 0.8235, 0.7940, 0.7624, 0.7290`, eight strict inequalities. Even `D >= 34`: `4(D-2) >= 128 > 25`, so `K(D) >= 2`, and minimality gives `5^K < 4(D-2)`, whence `2 5^K - 1 < 8D` and `K < log_5(4D)`; the window condition gives a right side at least `cos(pi/4)`; by `1 + x <= e^x`, `kappa(D, K) <= B(D) := (1 + (4 - hat g_2)/(D + hat g_2)) exp((4 - hat g_3)(log_5(4D) - 1)/(D + hat g_3))`, and `B` is decreasing on `D >= 34`, the first factor visibly and the exponent because `(D + hat g_3)/(D ln 5) - (log_5(4D) - 1) <= 0.6943 - 2.0524 < 0` there; with `B(34) <= 1.0089188` it suffices that `h(D) = D r^(D-1) < cos(pi/4)/(8 B(34))`, where the right side is at least `0.0876069`, and `h` decreases for `D > 1/|ln r| = 3.7884` with `h(34) <= 0.0056028`. Even `D <= 16`: exact integer certificates of Theorem 4.4, `K = 0` at `D = 2`, `K = 1` at `D = 4, ..., 14`, `K = 2` at `D = 16`, each the entrywise integer inequality with no floating point. The split is real: at `D = 16`, `K = 2` the analytic criterion reads `0.9499` against `0.9387` and fails, so `D = 18` is where it first bites. In all three cases Theorem 4.4 gives `rho_D < f_D/5`. □

Depth cannot be held fixed. Since `beta_K` has Fourier support in `5^(-K) Z`, the dominant term makes `Sigma_K(c) ~ 2 T_K(1) cos(2 pi c/5^(K+1))`, so a depth-`K` certificate sees only the carries inside the first quarter-period and must fail once `(D-2)/2` reaches `c_0(K) = ceil(5^(K+1)/4)`.

**Proposition 6.6 (every fixed depth dies).** For each fixed `K >= 1`, `(C_K)` fails at `c = c_0(K)` for all sufficiently large even `D`. Hence depth `K` certifies finitely many dimensions and the growth `K(D) = Theta(log D)` of Theorem 6.1 is necessary.

**Proof.** By Lemma 6.4 the `n = +-1` term beats the sum of all others by a factor `r^(-(D-1))/(2 5^K)` times a factor bounded uniformly in `D` at fixed `K` (`kappa(D, K) <= kappa(6, K)`). That factor exceeds `1/|cos(2 pi c_0/5^(K+1))|` for all large `D`, and `cos(2 pi c_0(K)/5^(K+1)) < 0` because `5^(K+1)/4` is never an integer. □

**Fact 6.7 (the exact deaths and the computed certificates).** At base `5` the exact integer certificate of Theorem 4.4 passes at every even `D <= 40` with the depth staircase `K = 0` at `D = 2`, `K = 1` at `4 <= D <= 14`, `K = 2` at `16 <= D <= 40`; depth `1` fails first at `D = 16`, at `c = +-7`, depth `2` passes through `D = 64` and fails first at `D = 66`, at `c = +-32` with relative deficit `-2.19e-43`, and depth `3` passes at `D = 314` and fails first at `D = 316`, at `c = +-157`, where depth `4` passes. Each first-failure dimension is `2 c_0(K) + 2` on the nose, so the death law `D = 2 ceil(5^(K+1)/4) + 2` is exact at `K = 1, 2, 3` and known at those three depths only. The analytic criterion of Proposition 6.5 holds directly at every even `34 <= D <= 600` and at every depth transition to `D = 10^6`. The minimal row-certificate depth of Theorem 4.3 is `t(D) = max(1, ceil(log_5(2D - 3)) - 1)`, with breakpoints exactly at `D = (5^(k+1) - 1)/4`, checked to even `D = 400` with the boundary `314 | 316` included; the `782` at `k = 4` is an extrapolation unobservable below `D = 1566`.

## Base 3: the even half entire

**Theorem 7.1 (the even half at base 3).** On the base-`3` middle-digit design, `rho_D < f_D/3` for every even `D >= 2`, `f_D = 2^(D-1)(D+2)`; equivalently the slice exponent lies strictly below `log_3 f_D - 1` in every even dimension.

Here `g_3(psi) = 2 cos psi` and `Phi_D(psi) = (2 cos psi)^(D-1)(D + 2 cos psi)`. Propositions 6.2 and 6.3 hold at `q = 3`, so `f_D beta_K(c) - 3 beta_(K+1)(c) = 3^(-K)(D-1) Sigma_K(c)` with `Sigma_K(c) = 2 sum_(1 <= n < 3^(K+1)/2, 3 does not divide n) T_K(n) cos(2 pi nc/3^(K+1))`, `T_K(n) = prod_(i=2)^(K+1) Phi_D(2 pi n/3^i)`, and the depth-`K` certificate is again `(C_K)`: `Sigma_K(c) > 0` on `|c| <= (D-2)/2`. One anchor: `beta_K(0) = b_D(K)` exactly, so `Sigma_K(0) = 3^K V(K)` by Theorem 4.1(ii), and the certificate at `c = 0` reads the census excess directly.

Everything that differs from base `5` is in the spectrum. Fix a level `i >= 2`, write `N = 3^i`, and for an admissible residue `k` (`3` not dividing `k`) put `a = min(k, N - k)`, the grid distance to `0`, and `b = |2k - N|/2`, the grid distance to the half-point; then `|g_3(2 pi k/N)| = 2 cos(2 pi min(a, b)/N)`.

**Lemma 7.2 (four nested tracks).** (i) The minima are `a = 1`, at `k = +-1`, and `b = 1/2`, at `k = h^(+-) = (N -+ 1)/2`; the four residues are distinct for `i >= 2`, and every other admissible `k` has `a >= 2` and `b >= 5/2`, hence `|g_3| <= 2 cos(4 pi/N)`. (ii) Reduction modulo `3^(i-1)` sends each of `1, N - 1, h^+, h^-` at level `i` to the corresponding residue at level `i - 1`; so a frequency on a track at level `i` is on the same track at every level `2 <= i' <= i`, and a frequency that leaves a track never returns to any track. (iii) On a `0`-track `|g_3| = hat g_i = 2 cos(2 pi/3^i)` with amplitude `D + hat g_i`; on a `pi`-track `|g_3| = tilde g_i = 2 cos(pi/3^i)`, with `g_3 < 0` and amplitude `D - tilde g_i`.

**Proof.** (i) `a` runs over positive integers prime to `3`, so after `1` comes `2`; `2b = |2k - N|` is odd because `N` is odd and prime to `3` because `3` does not divide `k`, so after `1` comes `5`; distinctness holds once `N >= 9`; the off-track bound is `2 cos` of an angular distance at least `4 pi/N`. (ii) `h^+(i) - h^+(i-1) = 3^(i-1)`, so `h^+(i) = h^+(i-1) mod 3^(i-1)`, likewise `h^-(i) = h^+(i) + 1`, `1 = 1` and `3^i - 1 = 3^(i-1) - 1`; downward induction gives the first claim and the never-return statement is its contrapositive. (iii) Direct evaluation; `g_3 < 0` on the `pi` side because the angle is within `pi/2` of `pi`. □

Because tracks are nested, every non-leading frequency has an exit level, the first level at which it leaves its track; this partitions the spectrum into exits from a `0`-track at each level, exits from a `pi`-track at each level, and the two residues `n = 2, 7 mod 9` that were never on a track above level `1`.

**Lemma 7.3 (the half-point pair).** Let `n_h = (3^(K+1) - 1)/2`. Then `T_K(n_h) = (-1)^K prod_(i=2)^(K+1) tilde g_i^(D-1) (D - tilde g_i)`, `T_K(1) = prod_(i=2)^(K+1) hat g_i^(D-1) (D + hat g_i) > 0`, and for integer `c`, `cos(2 pi n_h c/3^(K+1)) = (-1)^c cos(pi c/3^(K+1))`. The leader ratio is

```
r(D, K) = |T_K(n_h)|/T_K(1) = prod_(i=2)^(K+1) ( cos(pi/3^i)/cos(2 pi/3^i) )^(D-1) (D - tilde g_i)/(D + hat g_i) .
```

**Proof.** Direct evaluation on the four track residues of Lemma 7.2(iii); the sign is one negative `g_3` per level raised to the odd power `D - 1`, so `(-1)^((D-1)K) = (-1)^K` at even `D`. □

This is the whole difference between the bases. The half-point pair rides the fixed point `pi` of angle tripling and beats the dominant frequency in magnitude at every level, by `cos(pi/3^i)/cos(2 pi/3^i) > 1`; it pays only in amplitude, by about `(D-2)/(D+2)` per level. Put

```
R = prod_(i >= 2) cos(pi/3^i)/cos(2 pi/3^i) = 1.2553249438... ,
```

so the total magnitude advantage is `R^(D-1)` and the total amplitude cost about `((D-2)/(D+2))^K`. Its sign alternates with `K`, so while it leads it drags `Sigma_K(0)` negative at odd `K`. That is the transient.

**Lemma 7.4 (crossing estimates).** Write `l_i = log(cos(pi/3^i)/cos(2 pi/3^i)) > 0`, `A = log((D+2)/(D-2))`, and `s_D = sum_(i >= 2) [log((D - tilde g_i)/(D-2)) - log((D + hat g_i)/(D+2))]`, all summands positive and both series geometrically convergent. Then exactly

```
log r(D, K) = (D-1)[log R - LT(K)] - KA + s_D - ST(D, K) ,
```

with positive tails `LT(K) < 1.9 9^(-K)` and `ST(D, K) < 7 9^(-K)/(D-2)`. With

```
K*(D) = ( (D-1) log R + s_D ) / log((D+2)/(D-2)) ,
```

`r(D, K) < 1` for `K > K*(D)`, and `K >= K*(D) + 1` forces `r(D, K) <= (D-2)/(D+2)`.

**Proof.** Take the logarithm of the finite product of Lemma 7.3 and add and subtract the two full series; the tails are positive, so dropping them raises the bound, the safe direction for the last claim. The tail enclosures are `log cos` expansions, certified in interval arithmetic in the sharper forms `LT(K) <= 0.3579 9^(-K)` and `ST(D, K) <= 0.6919 9^(-K)/(D-2)` at `1 <= K <= 7`. □

Every frequency that is not one of the four leaders is exponentially small in `D`, uniformly; an exit cost paid where a frequency leaves its track and a subtree bound for everything it can do afterwards do that work.

**Lemma 7.5 (exit costs).** Measure each per-level weight against the dominant factor at that level. (i) A frequency exiting a `0`-track at level `j >= 3` has weight at most `(u_o(j)/hat g_j)^(D-1)` with `u_o(j) = 2 cos(pi/3 - 2 pi/3^j)`, and `u_o(j)/hat g_j` is maximal at `j = 3`, at most `0.7052518` there, decreasing to `1/2`. (ii) A frequency exiting a `pi`-track at level `j >= 3` has weight at most `(u_h(j)/hat g_j)^(D-1)` with `u_h(j) = 2 cos(pi/3 - pi/3^j)`, at most `0.6137010` at `j = 3`. (iii) The two residues `n = 2, 7 mod 9` have weight at most `0.2266816^(D-1)`. Combining a `pi`-track prefix, whose advantage is at most `R`, with its exit, the entry weight of a `pi`-track exit at level `j` is at most `0.7528157^(D-1)`, the maximum at `j = 3`; the branch constants are `0.7528157` at `j = 3`, `0.66966` at `j = 4` and `0.6419` for `j >= 5`.

**Proof.** From the `+1` track at level `j - 1` the non-staying digits give residues `1 + d 3^(j-1)`, `d` in `{1, 2}`, at angles `2 pi d/3 + 2 pi/3^j`; from the `-1` track the conjugate pair. Since `|2 cos|` at `2 pi/3 +- u` equals `2 cos(pi/3 -+ u)`, the larger branch is `u_o(j)`, with amplitude at most `D + u_o(j) < D + hat g_j`; as `j` grows `u_o(j)` decreases to `1` and `hat g_j` increases to `2`, so the ratio decreases and `j = 3` is the maximum, a certified interval value. Case (ii) is identical with `h^+` in place of `+1`, offsets `pi/3^j` in place of `2 pi/3^j`, exit angles `pi/3 - pi/3^j` and `5 pi/3 - pi/3^j`. Case (iii) is `2 cos(4 pi/9)/hat g_2` with amplitude ratio below `1`. The combined statement multiplies the prefix advantage `prod_(i=2)^(j-1) cos(pi/3^i)/cos(2 pi/3^i) <= R` by the exit weight and evaluates the three shapes. □

**Lemma 7.6 (subtree bound).** Let `sigma_i` be the supremum, over off-track admissible residues at level `i`, of the total weight of all continuations to level `K + 1`. Then `sigma_i <= prod_(i' > i) (1 + 2 (sqrt 3/hat g_(i'))^(D-1)) <= sigma := exp(2(K+1) 0.8900159^(D-1))`.

**Proof.** Downward induction from `sigma_(K+1) = 1`. Every child of an off-track residue is off-track by Lemma 7.2(ii), so by Lemma 7.2(i) each has `|g_3| <= 2 cos(4 pi/3^(i'))` and amplitude below the dominant's: every child has weight below `1`. The three child angles are `2 pi/3` apart, so at most one lies within `pi/6` of `{0, pi}`; bound that one by `1` and the other two by `(sqrt 3/hat g_(i'))^(D-1)`, using `|2 cos| <= 2 cos(pi/6) = sqrt 3` and `D + sqrt 3 < D + hat g_(i')` for `i' >= 3`. So `sigma_(i') <= (1 + 2(sqrt 3/hat g_(i'))^(D-1)) sigma_(i'+1)`, and `1 + x <= e^x` with `sqrt 3/hat g_(i') <= 0.8900159` finishes. □

**Proposition 7.7 (everything else is exponentially small).** For even `D >= 8` and every `K >= 2`, the non-leader mass obeys

```
E_K(D) := sum_(3 does not divide n mod 3^(K+1), n not in {+-1, +-n_h}) |T_K(n)|/T_K(1) <= [ 4(K-1)( 0.7528157^(D-1) + 0.7052518^(D-1) ) + 2 0.2266816^(D-1) ] sigma .
```

**Proof.** Partition by exit level. A `0`-track exit at level `j` in `{3, ..., K+1}` has four entry residues, each with prefix ratio exactly `1`, exit weight at most `0.7052518^(D-1)` by Lemma 7.5(i), and free continuations summing to at most `sigma` by Lemma 7.6; a `pi`-track exit at level `j` in `{3, ..., K+1}` likewise has four entry residues of entry weight at most `0.7528157^(D-1)`; that is `K - 1` levels of each kind, the coefficient displayed. The two residues `n = 2, 7 mod 9` contribute at most `2 0.2266816^(D-1) sigma`. The free digits above the exit level are exactly what `sigma` counts; they are not additional terms. □

**Proof of Theorem 7.1.** Let `D >= 38` be even and set `K_1 = K_1(D) = floor(sup[(D-1) log R + s_D]/inf A) + 2`, the supremum and infimum over the certified enclosures, so that `K_1 >= K*(D) + 1` and Lemma 7.4 gives `r(D, K_1) <= (D-2)/(D+2)`. For `|c| <= (D-2)/2`, Lemma 7.3 at the worst sign of the half-pair and Proposition 7.7 on the rest give

```
Sigma_(K_1)(c) >= 2 T_(K_1)(1) [ cos(2 pi c/3^(K_1+1)) - r(D, K_1) cos(pi c/3^(K_1+1)) - E_(K_1)(D) ] .
```

Since `K_1 >= K*(D) >= (log R/4)(D^2 - D) - 1`, the cosine deficit `delta(D) := 1 - cos(pi(D-2)/3^(K_1+1)) <= pi^2 (D-2)^2/(2 3^(2K_1+2))` is doubly exponentially small in `D`, below `4.1e-76` already at `D = 38`, with `log delta` falling like `-0.125 D^2`. Bounding `cos(pi c/3^(K_1+1)) <= 1` it therefore suffices that

```
(*)    E_(K_1)(D) < 4/(D+2) - delta(D) .
```

For `38 <= D <= 400` this is a finite check, `182` inequalities, each certified in rational-interval arithmetic with `K_1(D)` built from certified enclosures of `log R`, `s_D` and `A` and asserted to satisfy `K_1 >= K* + 1`; the scan is tight only at its left end, with slack a factor `1.1153` at `D = 38`, past `10^3` by `D = 60` and `4.3e42` at `D = 400`, the widest interval anywhere `8.4e-56` relative. Beyond `D = 400` monotone domination closes it: `K_1(D+2) - 1 <= ((D+2)(D+1)/(D(D-1)))(K_1(D) - 1) + 2 <= 1.0104 (K_1(D) - 1)`, so the bound of Proposition 7.7 has per-step ratio at most `1.0104 0.7528157^2 1.001 <= 0.573`, while the margin's per-step ratio is at least `((D+2)/(D+4))(1 - 3^(-K_1)) >= 0.9950`; the pass at `D = 400` with slack above `2` therefore propagates to every larger even `D`, the accumulated factors `1 - 3^(-K_1)` multiplying to more than `1 - 10^(-29)`. Hence `(C_(K_1))` holds and Theorem 4.4 gives `rho_D < f_D/3` for every even `D >= 38`. Even `2 <= D <= 36` is covered by the exact integer certificates of Theorem 4.4 at depth `K_min(D)`, entrywise over the integers, no floating point. □

The margin in `(*)` must be written with the true deficit `delta(D)` and not with an absolute constant: replacing `delta(D)` by a fixed `10^(-8)` makes the statement false, the margin vanishing near `D = 4e8`. The deficit form is what runs forever. The chain's single global safety factor is `2`, and the attainment of the `h`-exit at level `2`, two of four residues reaching the branch constant, is load-bearing.

**Fact 7.8 (the finite part and the checks of the chain).** The exact integer certificate of Theorem 4.4 passes at base `3` at every even `D <= 102` and on the grid `106, 110, ..., 178`, strictness included, with no determinant lemma and no exceptional class `D = 4 mod 6`; spot depths are `K_min = 8, 50, 140, 291` at `D = 12, 30, 50, 72`, and two implementations sharing no code reproduce all `36` rows to `D = 102` to every digit, including the two non-monotone slack rows. The theorem is machine-checked in exact integers at `D = 38, 40, 42`: the certificate holds at exactly `K_1`, fails at `0.8 K*`, and `K_1 = K_min + 1` at all three. The Fourier form of Proposition 6.2 and the telescoping of Proposition 6.3 at `q = 3` agree with the exact towers to `9.4e-61` and `2.6e-59`; the four tracks are exhaustive over all `n < 3^10` prime to `3`; the subtree bound is never exceeded (worst `sigma_5 = 1.023` against `8.97`); the envelope of Proposition 7.7 dominates the exact enumeration at `35` points `(D, K)` and at `28` fresh ones, `D in {10, 14, 22, 26} x K in {3, ..., 9}`, worst ratio `19.74`; the class counts are exact at `K = 9`; an exit-level sweep to `j = 60`, `D = 4000` finds the caps asymptotically exact (worst attainment `0.999121`) but never breached; and the seven certified constants were re-derived to `22` digits by exact interval arithmetic on a `10^(-90)` grid with outward rounding, where a hand-rounded `0.6696` reads `0.66966`. At `D = 10, 20` the half-pair carries the largest magnitude in the spectrum and the dominant pair only the third.

## The transient

The depth base `3` needs is forced by the census itself: since `Sigma_K(0) = 3^K V(K)`, the certificate at `c = 0` says `V(K) > 0`, so no depth at or below the last level where `V` dips negative can work. The dip is the half-point pair of Lemma 7.3, and its end is pinned by the crossing `K*(D)` of Lemma 7.4 to within one odd step, on either side.

Standing notation for this section: `D >= 38` is even, `L*(D)` is the last level `L` with `V(L) < 0`, `L_0(D)` is the greatest odd integer `<= K*(D)`, `K_1(D)` is the certified depth of the proof of Theorem 7.1, `E = E(D)` is the right side of Proposition 7.7 at `K = K_1(D)`, an upper bound for `E_K(D)` at every `K <= K_1` since that right side increases with `K` and at `K = 1` reads `2 0.2266816^(D-1) sigma`, which bounds `E_1(D)`, the two residues `n = 2, 7 mod 9`, directly by Lemma 7.5(iii), and `T(D) = (1.9(D-1) + 7/(D-2)) 9^(-L_0(D))`, the tail allowance of Lemma 7.4 at the levels that matter. Two facts about `E` carry over from the proof of Theorem 7.1: `E < 4/(D+2)` by `(*)`, and `2E < 1 - ((D-2)/(D+2))^2 = 8D/(D+2)^2`, certified directly at every even `38 <= D <= 400` and beyond `400` because the domination step leaves `E < 2/(D+2)` there, and `4/(D+2) <= 8D/(D+2)^2` for `D >= 2`.

**Theorem 8.1 (the transient, pinned to three values).** Let `D >= 38` be even. (i) `V(L) > 0` at every even `L`, and at every `L >= K_1(D)` of either parity. (ii) At odd `L <= K_1(D)`, `V(L) < 0` whenever `r(D, L) > 1 + E` and `V(L) > 0` whenever `r(D, L) < 1 - E`. (iii) `r(D, L) > 1 + E` at every odd `L <= L_0 - 2` and `r(D, L) < 1 - E` at every odd `L >= L_0 + 4`, and at most one odd `L` has `1 - E <= r(D, L) <= 1 + E`; that level, if it exists, is `L_0` or `L_0 + 2`. Hence

```
L*(D) in { L_0(D) - 2,  L_0(D),  L_0(D) + 2 } ,    L*(D) = (log R / 4)(D^2 - D) + O(1) ,
```

with `log R / 4 = 0.0568486146...`; more precisely `L* in {L_0, L_0 + 2}` when `L_0` is decided and `L* in {L_0 - 2, L_0}` when `L_0 + 2` is. (iv) The minimal certificate depth of Theorem 4.4 satisfies `L*(D) + 1 <= K_min(D) <= K_1(D) <= ceil(K*(D)) + 2`.

**Proof.** By the anchor and Lemma 7.3, `Sigma_L(0) = 2 T_L(1)[1 + (-1)^L r(D, L) + eta_L]` with `|eta_L| <= E_L(D) <= E` for `L <= K_1`, and `3^L V(L) = Sigma_L(0)`. (i) At even `L <= K_1` the bracket is at least `1 + r - E > 0`. At `L >= K_1`, `(C_(K_1))` holds by the proof of Theorem 7.1, so by Theorem 4.4 the row `v^T M^(K_1)` is positive entrywise, and Theorem 4.3 gives `V(L) > 0` for every `L >= K_1`; this is where the step above the window leans on the depth-`K_1` certificate rather than on the bracket, whose envelope `E_L(D)` is not controlled past `K_1`. (ii) At odd `L <= K_1` the bracket is `1 - r + eta`, at most `1 - r + E < 0` when `r > 1 + E` and at least `1 - r - E > 0` when `r < 1 - E`; both inequalities are strict and the strictness is used, since `r = 1 + E` with `eta = E` would give `V(L) = 0`.

(iii) By Lemma 7.4, `log r(D, L) = (K* - L) A - tau_L` with `0 <= tau_L <= (1.9(D-1) + 7/(D-2)) 9^(-L)`, and `A = log((D+2)/(D-2)) >= 4/(D+2)`. Odd `L <= L_0 - 2` has `K* - L >= 2`. If `L >= 2 log_9 D + 1`, then `tau_L <= 0.22/D` and `log r >= 8/(D+2) - 0.22/D > 4/(D+2) > E >= log(1+E)`. If `L < 2 log_9 D + 1`, read the finite product of Lemma 7.3 directly: `log r(D, L) >= (D-1) l_2 - LA >= 0.2043(D-1) - (2 log_9 D + 1)(4/(D-2)) > 5` at every `D >= 38`, since `l_2 = log(cos(pi/9)/cos(2 pi/9)) = 0.20431...` and every other summand is positive. Odd `L >= L_0 + 4` has `L - K* > 2`, so `log r <= -2A <= -8/(D+2) < log(1 - E)`, because `1 - e^(-8/(D+2)) >= 7.2/(D+2) > 4/(D+2) > E`. For the window, suppose odd `L` and `L + 2` both have `r` in `[1 - E, 1 + E]`; then `r(D, L)/r(D, L+2) <= (1+E)/(1-E) <= 1/(1-2E) < ((D+2)/(D-2))^2` by the certified inequality, while `log(r(D, L)/r(D, L+2)) = 2A + tau_(L+2) - tau_L >= 2A - tau_L`, and `tau_L <= T(D) < 10^(-70)` because any `L` in the window has `L >= L_0`, as just shown, and `L_0 >= 79`; the margin `log((1-2E)((D+2)/(D-2))^2)` is at least `0.013` at `D = 38` and at least `4/D` beyond `400`, far above `T(D)`, a contradiction. So the window holds at most one odd level, in `{L_0, L_0 + 2}`. Every odd `L <= L_0 - 2` has `V(L) < 0` by (ii), so `L* >= L_0 - 2`; every odd `L >= L_0 + 4` has `V(L) > 0` by (ii) below `K_1` and by (i) above it, so `L* <= L_0 + 2`; with (i), `L*` is odd. Since `K* - L_0 >= 0`, `r(D, L_0) >= e^(-T(D)) > 1 - E`, so `L_0` is decided negative or undecided; since `L_0 + 2 > K*`, `r(D, L_0 + 2) < 1`, so `L_0 + 2` is decided positive or undecided. If `L_0` is decided, `V(L_0) < 0` and `L* in {L_0, L_0 + 2}`; if `L_0 + 2` is decided, `V(L_0 + 2) > 0` and `L* in {L_0 - 2, L_0}`. For the asymptotic, `A = (4/D)(1 + O(D^(-2)))` and `s_D = O(1/D)`, each summand of `s_D` being `O(9^(-i)/D)`, so `K*(D) = (log R / 4)(D^2 - D) + O(1)` and `L* = K* + O(1)`.

(iv) `K_min > L*` because `(C_K)` at `c = 0` is `V(K) > 0`; `K_min <= K_1` because `(C_(K_1))` holds; and `K_1 = floor(S/I) + 2 <= ceil(K*) + 2`, where `S/I` is the certified enclosure's upper value for `K*`, which exceeds `K*` by less than `1`, the enclosures being `8.4e-56` relative (Theorem 7.1). □

The argument leaves exactly one step open per dimension: the sign of `V` at the one undecided odd level, when there is one. Whether that level is `L_0` or `L_0 + 2` is a question about where `K*(D)` falls between odd integers, and it can be read off `D` by `D`.

**Proposition 8.2 (the per-dimension condition).** Let `D >= 38` be even and put `w(D) = (-log(1 - E(D)) + T(D))/A(D)`. If the distance from `K*(D)` to the nearest odd integer exceeds `w(D)`, then `L*(D) = L_0(D)`. At every even `D >= 38`, `w(D) < 1.1 E(D)/A(D)`.

**Proof.** If `K* - L_0 > w(D)`, then `log r(D, L_0) = (K* - L_0) A - tau_(L_0) > -log(1 - E) + T(D) - T(D) >= log(1 + E)`, so `V(L_0) < 0` by Theorem 8.1(ii). If `L_0 + 2 - K* > w(D)`, then `log r(D, L_0 + 2) <= -(L_0 + 2 - K*) A < log(1 - E)`, so `V(L_0 + 2) > 0`. With Theorem 8.1(iii) both give `L* = L_0`. For the last claim, `-log(1 - E) <= E/(1 - E) <= 1.099 E` since `E <= 0.0897` at `D = 38` and decreases, and `T(D)/A(D)` is below `10^(-3) E/A` at every even `D >= 38`, `T` falling like `9^(-0.0568 D^2)` against `E >= 2 0.2266816^(D-1)`. □

The condition is Diophantine: it fails exactly when `K*(D)` lands within `w(D)` of an odd integer, and `w(D)` shrinks like `D^3 0.75^D`. It has failed once in the computed range.

**Fact 8.3 (the transient, read exactly).** `L*(D) = L_0(D)` at every even `6 <= D <= 120`, `58` dimensions, no misses, each row exhausted by proof and not by a census window: the row vector `r_t = (M^T)^t v` of Theorem 4.3 is swept on the folded even block until the first `t` with `r_t >= 0` entrywise, which by Theorem 4.3 forces `V(L) >= 0` at every `L >= t`, so `L* = max{L <= t : V(L) < 0}` with no window assumption, and `V(L) = r_L(0)` reads the whole sign sequence off the same sweep; `K*(D)` is evaluated at `60` digits over `400` terms and misses every integer by more than `0.017138`, the minimum at `D = 38`. Every row closes strictly, so by Theorem 4.4 the stopping level is `K_min(D)` exactly: `K_min = L* + 1` on `36` rows and `L* + 2` on the `22` rows `D = 14, 22, 32, 38, 40, 48, 52, 54, 58, 70, 72, 76, 84, 92, 96, 98, 100, 106, 112, 114, 116, 118`, with towers `L* = 79, 97, 107` at `D = 38, 42, 44` and `L* = 811`, `K_min = 812` at `D = 120`. At `D = 40`, where `K* = 88.7719`, `L_0 = 87`, `E = 0.0412`, `w(D) = 0.42` and the odd integer `89` sits inside the window at distance `0.228`, Theorem 8.1 alone leaves `L* in {87, 89}`; the sweep prints `V(87) = -453994219280... ` (`1116` digits), `V(88) = +374615946025...` (`1130` digits), `V(89) = +312749611549...` (`1141` digits), every odd `L <= 87` negative, every even `L` positive, and `K_min = 89` strict, so `L* = 87 = L_0`. At every other even `38 <= D <= 130` the distance from `K*(D)` to the nearest odd integer exceeds `w(D)`, the nearest misses being `D = 38`, distance `0.983` against `w = 0.892`, and `D = 108`, `K* = 657.0320`, distance `0.032` against `w = 4.6e-9`, so Proposition 8.2 pins `L* = L_0` there without a sweep, and `L* = L_0` holds at every even `6 <= D <= 130`. A census carried only to a window `4D + c` is unsound past `D` about `70`, since `L*` is quadratic and such a census returns the largest odd level inside its window; no row here is within reach of that error. Generator: `cuts/lab/py/base3-transient-exhaustion`, `transient.py --selftest --lo 6 --hi 120`, whose self-test rebuilds `V(L)` from the unfolded census and the unfolded row sweep on all of `S` at even `4 <= D <= 36`; the `D = 40` values are printed by `transient.py --values 40 85 91` and the window table by `transient.py --window 38 130`, the envelope `E` built from the constants of Lemmas 7.5 and 7.6 at `K_1 = floor(K*) + 2`.

The table invites the fit `K_min = (9/160) D^2`, and it is not a law: the residual reaches `+2.00` by `D = 120` and `+9.78` at `D = 178`, and `9/160 = 0.05625` is the first two digits of `log R / 4 = 0.0568486...`.

**Lemma 8.4 (uniqueness of base 3).** For odd `q`, `|A_q(-1)| = A_q(1)` if and only if `q = 3`.

**Proof.** `A_q(1) = q - 1`. Since `q` is odd, `sum_(d=0)^(q-1) (-1)^d = 1`, so `A_q(-1) = 1 - (-1)^m`, which is `0` for `q = 1 mod 4` and `2` for `q = 3 mod 4`; equality with `q - 1` forces `q = 3`. □

That one line is the whole dichotomy. The half-point pair of Lemma 7.3 exists because the design symbol at the fixed point `pi` of angle multiplication has the same modulus as at `0`; the half-point track carries strength `|A_q(-1)|/A_q(1)` per level, which is `1` at `q = 3`, `0` at every `q = 1 mod 4` (the `pi`-track dead outright, the base-`5` case, and base `9 = 3^2` with it) and `2/(q-1) < 1` at every `q = 3 mod 4`, `q >= 7`, crushed exponentially in `D`. Only at `q = 3` do the two fixed points fight at equal magnitude, and only there does the certificate pay a quadratic transient rather than a logarithmic depth.

**Fact 8.5 (bases 7, 9 and 11).** Exact integer certificates of Theorem 4.4 give `rho_D < f_D/7` at every even `D <= 26` and at `D = 172, 174`, `rho_D < f_D/9` at every even `D <= 56` and `rho_D < f_D/11` at every even `D <= 74`, with `K_min <= 2` everywhere but `K_min = 3` at `D = 174`, `q = 7`; at base `7` the depth steps `0 -> 1 -> 2` at `D = 4` and `D = 26`, and `2 -> 3` at exactly `D = 174`, where the frontier `f_2 = 85` had converged from `D = 160`. There is no transient off base `3`: `V(L) > 0` at every even `D <= 40` and every `L <= 25` at `q = 7`, and at `q = 9, 11` on their ranges, no dip and no exact zero, with the carry window exactly closed, so the obstruction `K_min >= L* + 1` is vacuous there. Base `9` inherits nothing from base `3`. Measured against the asymptotic death point `D = 2 ceil(q^(K+1)/4) + 2` of the depth-`K` certificate, the earliness in even steps is `1, 0, 0` at `q = 5` (`K = 0, 1, 2`), `1, 1, 0` at `q = 7`, `2, 1` at `q = 9` and `2, 2` at `q = 11`, the depth-`0` death being `D = 4` at every base; since `Sigma_K(c)` depends on `c` modulo `q^(K+1)` and the residue `0` is favourable, a window edge divisible by the base is immune while its neighbours fail, at `q = 9` at `D = 20` and `D = 38`, so any tightness statement must be made modulo `q`.

## The tent rank law

Strictness in the last residue class is, by Theorem 5.4, an upper bound on `v_2(det M_even)`, and `v_2(det M_even) = sum_(k >= 1) L_k` over the `2`-adic Smith layers, `L_k` the number of elementary divisors of valuation at least `k`. This section proves the first layer exactly. Throughout, `q = 3`, `D = 2R + 1` is odd, `n = R + 1`, `omega = 6R + 2` is a degree bound fixed once, polynomial arithmetic is over `F_2` unless stated, `u = t^3`, and `v = v_(1+t)` is the `(1+t)`-adic valuation. Modulo `2` the digit polynomial collapses: `P_D = (1 + t^2)^(D-1)(1 + Dt + t^2) = (1+t)^(4R)(1 + t + t^2) =: G`, of degree `4R + 2`, since `D` is odd. The Jacobsthal numbers are `J(k) = (2^k - (-1)^k)/3`, so `J(0), J(1), ... = 0, 1, 1, 3, 5, 11, 21, 43, 85, ...` (A001045). Put

```
T = { 2J(k) + 1, 2J(k) + 3 : k >= 2 } ,    tent(D) = min_(t in T) ( |D - t|/2 + 1 ) ,
```

a saw of V-shaped valleys with floor `1`, one valley per octave, the valley bottoms where `3D` is adjacent to a power of two.

**Theorem 9.1 (the tent rank law).** For the base-`3` design and every odd `D = 2R + 1 >= 3`,

```
nullity_2(M_even) = tent(D) <= ceil(n/3) ,    n = ceil(D/2) ,
```

with equality in the bound exactly at `D` in `{3} ∪ {2^(2j) + 1 : j >= 1}`.

The proof is a chain of five lemmas. Two of them lean on named finite checks, identified exactly.

**Lemma 9.2 (extraction form).** With carries `|c|, |c'| <= R`, `M[c', c] = [x^(3(R - c') + 1)] (P_D x^(R - c))`, so after reversing the row order `M` is the map `E` sending `X` to `([x^(3j+1)](P_D X))_(0 <= j <= 2R)` on polynomials of degree at most `2R`. Writing `X = X_0 + x X_1 + x^2 X_2` and `P_D = P_0 + x P_1 + x^2 P_2` in `y = x^3`, `E(X) = P_1 X_0 + P_0 X_1 + y P_2 X_2`, the generalized Sylvester matrix of the polyphase triple `(P_1, P_0, y P_2)` with columns interleaved by residue class.

**Proof.** The first display is Definition 2.5 at `q = 3` with `j = R - c'`, since `c + D - 3c' = 3j + 1 - (R - c)`. For the second, a monomial `x^a x^b` of `P_D X` contributes to `x^(3j+1)` exactly when `a + b = 1 mod 3`, and `1 = 1 + 0 = 0 + 1 = 2 + 2 mod 3` gives the three terms, the last shifted by one power of `y`. □

**Lemma 9.3 (the dictionary).** Let `Z = {H in F_2[t] : no exponent of H is 1 mod 3}`, a free `F_2[u]`-module with basis `{1, t^2}`, and `Y = Z ∩ G F_2[t]`. Then `X -> GX` is an `F_2`-isomorphism from `ker_2 M` onto `Y_(<= omega)`, and `nullity_2(M_even) = ceil(nullity_2(M)/2)`.

**Proof.** By Lemma 9.2 and `P_D = G mod 2`, a polynomial `X` of degree at most `2R` lies in `ker_2 M` exactly when `GX` has no exponent `1 mod 3`, that is when `H = GX` lies in `Z`; and `deg H <= (4R + 2) + 2R = omega`. The map is injective because `F_2[t]` is a domain and surjective onto `Y_(<= omega)` because every `H` there is divisible by `G` with quotient of degree at most `2R`. For the second display, the reflection of Lemma 2.7 acts on `ker_2 M`; by Lemma 9.5, whose proof uses only the first display, that kernel is `span{u^l g_1 : 0 <= l <= L}` for a single generator `g_1`, the reflection permutes this basis by reversing `l`, and its fixed subspace, which is `ker_2 M_even` by the splitting of Proposition 2.8, has dimension `ceil((L+1)/2)`. □

**Lemma 9.4 (sharp valuation bound).** For `r` in `{0, 1, 2}` and `d >= 2` let `Z_r(d) = {H : deg H <= d, no exponent of H is r mod 3}` and `V_r(d) = max{v(H) : 0 != H in Z_r(d)}`. Let `s_0(b, r) = (r + 2^b) mod 3`, call `b` legal for `(r, d)` when `2^b + s_0(b, r) <= d`, and for legal `b` put `h_r(b, d) = floor((d - s_0(b, r) - 2^b)/3) + 2^b` and `mu_r(d) = max_(b legal) h_r(b, d)`. Then `V_r(d) = mu_r(d)`, and `d >= 2` is sharp.

**Proof.** Lower bound: for legal `b` put `s_0 = s_0(b, r)`, `i = floor((d - s_0 - 2^b)/3)` and `H_(b,i) = t^(s_0) (1 + t^3)^i (1 + t)^(2^b) = t^(s_0)(1 + t^3)^i (1 + t^(2^b))`; its degree is `s_0 + 3i + 2^b <= d`, `v(H_(b,i)) = i + 2^b` since `v(1 + t^3) = 1` and `v(1 + t^(2^b)) = 2^b`, and its support meets only the exponent classes `{s_0, s_0 + 2^b} = {r + 2^b, r + 2 2^b} mod 3`, neither of which is `r` since `2^b != 0 mod 3`. So `V_r(d) >= mu_r(d)`.

The Frobenius split: write `H = A^2 + t B^2` with `A, B` the even and odd halves. Since `v(t) = 0`, `v(A^2) = 2v(A)` and `v(tB^2) = 2v(B)`; if the two differ or one term vanishes, `v(H)` is the smaller of the two or the surviving one. If `v(A) = v(B) = w`, put `A = (1+t)^w A_1`, `B = (1+t)^w B_1` with `A_1(1) = B_1(1) = 1`; then `H = (1+t)^(2w) C` with `C = A_1^2 + t B_1^2`, `C(1) = 0`, and in characteristic `2`, `C' = B_1^2`, so `C'(1) = 1` and `v(C) = 1` exactly. In all cases `v(H) <= Phi(v(A), v(B))` with `Phi(X, Y) = max(2X, 2Y, 2 min(X, Y) + 1)`.

Class bookkeeping: the exponents of `H` are `2e` and `2o + 1` for exponents `e` of `A` and `o` of `B`; as `2^(-1) = 2 mod 3`, `H` avoids class `r` iff `A` avoids `r_e = 2r mod 3` and `B` avoids `r_o = 2r + 1 mod 3`, with `deg A <= d_e = floor(d/2)` and `deg B <= d_o = floor((d-1)/2)`. Hence `V_r(d) <= Phi(V_(r_e)(d_e), V_(r_o)(d_o))`, and `Phi` is nondecreasing in each argument, so upper bounds may be substituted.

`mu` is a supersolution: rewriting `h_r(b, d) = floor((d - s_0(b, r) + 2^(b+1))/3)` shows `h_r(., d)` nondecreasing in `b`, so `mu_r(d) = h_r(B_r(d), d)` at the largest legal block `B_r(d)`. Take the even child's maximising block `b_e`, with `Q = 2^(b_e)`, and lift it to the parent block `2Q`: one checks `s_0(b_e, r_e) = 2 s_0(b_e + 1, r) mod 3`, that the parent block is legal, and, writing `nu = d_e - s_0(b_e, r_e) + 2Q = 3k + j` and `eps = d - 2 d_e` in `{0, 1}`, that `mu_r(d) >= 2X + floor((2j + 2 s_0(b_e, r_e) - sigma + eps)/3)` with `X = mu_(r_e)(d_e)` and `sigma = s_0(b_e + 1, r)`, whose bracket is `>= 0` always and `>= 3` when `sigma = 1`. The odd route is the same computation with `b_o`, giving `mu_r(d) >= 2Y` always and `>= 2Y + 1` when `sigma != 1`. If `X != Y` then `Phi = 2 max(X, Y)` and we are done. If `X = Y` then `Phi = 2X + 1`, and one of the two routes supplies the extra unit unless the even route has `sigma != 1` and the odd route `sigma = 1`, which forces `b_e` and `b_o` of opposite parity, in particular `b_e != b_o`; a gap estimate on the numerators, `|N_X - N_Y| >= 2^(min(b_e, b_o) + 1) - 2 >= 3` once `min(b_e, b_o) >= 2`, then forces `X != Y`, a contradiction, and `min(b_e, b_o) <= 1` implies `d <= 12`.

Assembly: strong induction on `d`. The base cases `d` in `{2, 3, 4}` and the residual window `d = 5, ..., 12` are finite, `9` and `24` evaluations over `r` in `{0, 1, 2}`, each an exact `F_2` computation by brute force over all admissible polynomials; for `d >= 13` the two children satisfy the inductive hypothesis and the three displays chain. □

**Lemma 9.5 (the window).** `Y` is free of rank `2` over `F_2[u]` with generator degrees `delta_1 < delta_2` satisfying `delta_1 + delta_2 = 12R + 5`. Consequently `delta_1 <= 6R + 2 = omega < 6R + 3 <= delta_2`, `Y_(<= omega) = span{u^l g_1 : 0 <= l <= L}` with `L = floor((omega - delta_1)/3)`, and `nullity_2(M) = L + 1`.

**Proof.** `Y` is the kernel of `Z -> F_2[t]/(G)`, so `dim_(F_2) Z/Y <= deg G` is finite; a submodule of rank at most `1` of the rank-`2` module `Z` has infinite codimension, so `Y` is free of rank exactly `2`. Every nonzero element of `Z` has leading exponent not `1 mod 3`, so `delta_1, delta_2` lie in `{0, 2} mod 3`; if they agreed mod `3` then `g_2 + u^l g_1` with `3l = delta_2 - delta_1` would be an element outside `F_2[u] g_1` of degree below `delta_2`, a contradiction; so the two residues are `{0, 2}` and residue separation makes `(g_1, g_2)` a basis with degree set `(delta_1 + 3N) ∪ (delta_2 + 3N)`. Counting in a truncation `Z_(<= 3N)` for large `N` gives `dim_(F_2) Z/Y = (delta_1 + delta_2 - 2)/3`. Separately, write `F_2[t] = Z ⊕ W` with `W = span{t^(3k+1)}` and let `pi` be the projection onto `W`; both summands are stable under multiplication by `t^3`, so `pi` is `F_2[u]`-linear and `pi((G))` is generated by `pi(G), pi(tG), pi(t^2 G)`. With `G = A_0(t^3) + t A_1(t^3) + t^2 A_2(t^3)` and `W = F_2[u]` these are `A_1, A_0, u A_2`, so `dim W/pi((G)) = deg_u gcd(A_0, A_1, A_2)` using `A_0(0) = G(0) = 1`. That gcd is the largest `d(u)` with `d(t^3) | G`; the roots of `G` are the cube roots of unity, so any irreducible `kappa(u)` with `kappa(t^3) | G` has `1` as its only root, `kappa = 1 + u`, and `(1 + t^3)^a = (1+t)^a (1 + t + t^2)^a` divides `G` only for `a <= 1` since `1 + t + t^2` has multiplicity exactly `1` in `G`. Hence the gcd is `1 + u`, `dim F_2[t]/(Z + (G)) = 1`, and `dim Z/Y = deg G - 1 = 4R + 1`. Combining, `delta_1 + delta_2 = 3(4R + 1) + 2 = 12R + 5`. That number is odd, so `delta_1 != delta_2` and `2 delta_1 < 12R + 5`, giving `delta_1 <= 6R + 2 = omega` and `delta_2 = 12R + 5 - delta_1 >= 6R + 3 > omega`. For `f = a g_1 + b g_2` of degree at most `omega`, `b != 0` would force `deg f >= delta_2 > omega`; so `b = 0` and the span is as displayed. The nullity is the first display of Lemma 9.3. □

The whole window lemma is that one parity: the observed margin `delta_2 - omega = 1` at the valley bottoms is what an odd sum looks like. The classical shadow is the `mu`-basis degree identity for the syzygy module of three polynomials over a field, `mu_1 + mu_2 = n - deg gcd`, here in its gcd-corrected form because the polyphase triple is not coprime, its gcd over `F_2[u]` being exactly `1 + u`; what is new is the evaluation `12R + 5` in the grading where the striped map mixes `x`-degree and `y`-degree and the window is the degree-`omega` truncation in `t`.

**Lemma 9.6 (closed form for the generator degree).** Let `a = floor(log_2(4R - 1))`. Then `{delta_1, delta_2} = {12R - 2 2^a + 2[a even], 2 2^a + 3 + 2[a odd]}`.

**Proof.** For `b >= 0` put `Q = 2^b`, `s_0(b) = 0` for `b` odd and `2` for `b` even, `i = max(1, 4R - Q)`, and `H_b = t^(s_0(b)) (1 + t^3)^i (1 + t^Q)`. Then `H_b` lies in `Y`: its support meets the classes `{s_0(b), s_0(b) + Q} = {0, 2} mod 3` for both parities of `b`, so `H_b` is in `Z`; `v(H_b) = i + Q >= 4R`; and `(1 + t + t^2) | (1 + t^3)^i` since `i >= 1`; hence `G | H_b`. Its degree is `psi(b) = s_0(b) + 3 max(1, 4R - Q) + Q`, of class `2 mod 3` for `b` odd and `0` for `b` even. Let `E_2 = min_(b odd) psi(b)` and `E_0 = min_(b even) psi(b)`. With `x = 4R` and `phi(Q) = 3 max(1, x - Q) + Q`, which is `3x - 2Q` for `Q <= x - 1` and `Q + 3` for `Q >= x - 1`, decreasing then increasing, each parity's optimum sits at an extreme admissible power of two. Since `x - 1 = 4R - 1` is odd and at least `3` it is never a power of two, so `2^a < x - 1 < 2^(a+1)`, that is `2^a + 2 <= x <= 2^(a+1)`. Writing `p = a mod 2`, the largest power of parity `p` below `x - 1` is `2^a` and the smallest above is `4 2^a`; for the other parity they are `2^a/2` and `2 2^a`. Hence `m_p = min(3x - 2 2^a, 4 2^a + 3) = 3x - 2 2^a` using `x <= 2 2^a`, and `m_(p') = min(3x - 2^a, 2 2^a + 3) = 2 2^a + 3` using `x >= 2^a + 2`. Their sum is `3x + 3 = 12R + 3`, and exactly one parity is even and contributes the offset `2`, so `E_0 + E_2 = 12R + 5`. By the residue separation in Lemma 9.5 the two minimal degrees `delta_1, delta_2` are the minimal degrees of `Y`-elements in the classes `0` and `2 mod 3`; the family gives `delta_((0)) <= E_0` and `delta_((2)) <= E_2`, and adding against `delta_1 + delta_2 = 12R + 5 = E_0 + E_2` forces both to be equalities. □

**Lemma 9.7 (Step E).** Let `a = floor(log_2(4R - 1))` and `eta = R - J(a)`. Then `nullity_2(M) = 1 - 2 eta` for `eta <= 0` and `2 eta` for `eta >= 1`; `nullity_2(M_even) = 1 + dist(R, {J(a), J(a) + 1})`; and the right side equals `tent(2R + 1)`.

**Proof.** Three Jacobsthal identities: `3J(k) = 2^k - (-1)^k`, so `2^a = 3J(a) + (-1)^a`; `J(k-1) + J(k) = 2^(k-1)`; and `J(k+1) - J(k) >= 2` for `k >= 2`. Also `2^a + 2 <= 4R <= 2 2^a` as in Lemma 9.6, and `4 | (4R - 2^a)` for `a >= 2`, hence `4R >= 2^a + 4` there. Crossover: write `alpha = 12R - 2 2^a + 2[a even]` and `beta = 2 2^a + 3 + 2[a odd]`. For `a` even, `alpha <= beta` iff `12R <= 4 2^a + 1`, and since `12R = 0` and `4 2^a + 1 = 1 mod 4` this is `3R <= 2^a = 3J(a) + 1`, that is `eta <= 0`; for `a` odd the same reduction gives `3R <= 2^a + 1 = 3J(a)`, again `eta <= 0`. So `delta_1 = alpha` exactly when `eta <= 0`. The nullity: four evaluations of `omega - delta_1 = 6R + 2 - delta_1`, eliminating `2^a` by `3J(a) = 2^a - (-1)^a`, give `omega - delta_1` equal to `-6 eta + 2`, `6 eta - 3`, `-6 eta`, `6 eta - 1` in the four cases (`a` even or odd, `eta <= 0` or `eta >= 1`), so `floor((omega - delta_1)/3) + 1` is `1 - 2 eta` for `eta <= 0` and `2 eta` for `eta >= 1`: the parity of `a` cancels completely. Halving as in Lemma 9.3, `1 - 2 eta` is odd with ceiling-half `1 - eta`, and `2 eta` is even with half `eta`; and `dist(R, {J(a), J(a) + 1})` is `-eta` for `eta <= 0` and `eta - 1` for `eta >= 1`, which matches. The nearest valley is the one at the same scale: write `d_k(R)` for the distance from `R` to `{J(k), J(k) + 1}`, so `tent(2R + 1) = 1 + min_(k >= 2) d_k(R)`. Each `d_k` is `1`-Lipschitz in `R`, and `R` ranges over the window from `2^(a-2) + 1` to `2^(a-1)`. At the right endpoint `J(a+1) - 2^(a-1)` and `2^(a-1) - J(a)` both equal `J(a-1)`, while `d_a = J(a-1) - 1`, a margin of exactly `1`; at the left endpoint `d_(a-1) - d_a = 1` likewise. Lipschitz propagation of a margin `1` across the window gives `d_a(R) < d_(a-1)(R)` and `d_a(R) < d_(a+1)(R)` throughout, and monotonicity of `J` handles `|k - a| >= 2`. Hence `d_a(R) = min_k d_k(R)`. □

**Proof of Theorem 9.1.** The identity is Lemmas 9.3, 9.5, 9.6 and 9.7 in that order, with Lemma 9.4 supplying the sharp valuation bound behind the generator family. For the cap, use Lemma 9.7 in the form `nullity_2(M_even) = |eta| + [eta <= 0]`. On the branch `eta >= 1` the inequality `3(R - J(a)) <= R + 1` is `2R <= 3J(a) + 1 = 2^a - (-1)^a + 1`, which follows from `R <= 2^a/2`, with equality only when `a` is even and `R = 2^(a-1)`. On the branch `eta <= 0` the inequality `3(1 + J(a) - R) <= R + 1` is `2^a - (-1)^a + 2 <= 4R`, which follows strictly from `4R >= 2^a + 2` (`a` even) and `4R >= 2^a + 4` (`a` odd, `a >= 3`). The single exception is `a = 1`, that is `R = 1`, where the nullity is `1` and `ceil(n/3) = 1`: the sole reason the cap carries a ceiling rather than a floor. Equality holds exactly at `R = 1` and at `R = 2^(a-1)` with `a` even, that is `D` in `{3} ∪ {2^(2j) + 1}`, where `nullity_2(M_even) = J(a-1) = n/3`. □

At `D = 3` the even block `[[6, 6], [1, 3]]` has determinant `12` and mod-`2` nullity `1 = tent(3)`, the equality case. So `v_2(det M_even) = tent(D) + X(D)` with the tent capped at `ceil(n/3)`, and base-`3` strictness rides on the deeper layers `X(D)` alone.

**Fact 9.8 (the tent, checked).** `nullity_2(M_even) = tent(D)` at every odd `3 <= D <= 1401`, computed from the matrix built from `P_D` and not from any closed form; the closed forms of Lemmas 9.6 and 9.7 agree with the module identities to `R = 1024` and with an independent minimisation of the generator-degree function at `R <= 500000`, with points to `2^60`, the argmin strictly unique everywhere and no residue family past the cap; Lemma 9.4 is brute-forced to `d <= 16000`, its upper bound certified independently by full rank of Lucas submask matrices at `d = 1023, ..., 8193`, the supersolution tight at `4926` points up to `2^60` with minimum slack `0`, the case law exact on all `H < 2^17`; the window identity `delta_1 + delta_2 = 3(deg G - deg_u gcd) + 2` holds at `400` random `G`, the closed form to `R = 200000`, margins below `5` lying in `{1, 3, 4}` exactly as parity predicts, with `R = 683 = J(11)` at margin `1` and `R = 1365 = J(12)` at margin `3`; without the `(1 + t + t^2)` hypothesis the valuation lemma yields only `tent + 1`, witnesses `R = 2, 4, 7`; the staircase submatrix with rows `c' = R - j` yields only `floor((R-1)/3) + 1` independent rows, the wrong third of the rank. Generator: `spectra/lab/py/smith-cascade` for the nullity against the tent at odd `D <= 511`; the deep ranges are the shelf papers' checks, named in the Reproducibility section.

## What is in print

The carries chain is classical. Add `D` integers written in base `q` whose digits are independent and uniform on `{0, ..., q-1}`; the carries `0 = kappa_0, kappa_1, ...` form a Markov chain on `{0, ..., D-1}`, Holte's amazing matrix, with transition probabilities

```
P(i, j) = q^(-D) sum_(r = 0)^(j - floor(i/q)) (-1)^r C(D+1, r) C(D - 1 - i + (j + 1 - r) q, D) ,
```

as Diaconis and Fulman recall it in their property (H1) before identifying the same matrix with the descent process of riffle shuffling; the chain is doubly rooted in print, in the carries literature and in the shuffling one. The matrix of Definition 2.5 departs from that frame in two independent ways, and both matter. First, the design restricts digit vectors jointly across coordinates, at most one coordinate carrying the middle digit, so `P_D` is not a product of `D` one-coordinate factors. Second, the outgoing digit is pinned rather than summed over, because the census fixes a hyperplane: an entry of `M` is a single coefficient of `P_D` where Holte's is a sum of `q` consecutive coefficients, so `M` is not stochastic, and its column sums are the root-of-unity filter of Proposition 2.12. Undo both departures and one recovers `q^D` times Holte's matrix on his recurrent states, once the orientation is fixed (his row index is the incoming carry) and his range `{0, ..., D-1}` is folded onto the centred window of Lemma 2.6. Keep them and the matrix leaves that theory: at `q = 3`, `D = 3` the even block `[[6, 6], [1, 3]]` has the irrational Perron root `(9 + sqrt 33)/2`. No treatment of jointly restricted digits, and no arithmetic study of a carry matrix of any kind, reduction modulo a prime, Smith form, `p`-adic elementary divisors, rank or nullity, is known to us; Section 9 is such a study.

That some constant-coefficient recurrence exists is free, as the Introduction says: a finite carry state space makes the census a `q`-regular sequence, and the untrimmed automaton gives order `2D + 1`. The `D = 3` slice is in print as the hexagon of six-pointed stars; its tile substitution on hexagons and triangles, recorded on the spectra page of this tree, has the trace `9` and determinant `12` of the even block, its census is A299916 up to an index shift, the Menger reading of that entry being a user comment, and the dimension `log_3((9 + sqrt 33)/2) = 1.818410` is the published one. The `D = 4` diagonal cut is in print for its geometry and its pictures, with no count and no sequence. Behind Section 9 stands a classical fact of polynomial-matrix theory, that the kernel module of a `1 x 3` polynomial row over a field is free of rank `2` with a forced degree sum; what is new there is the evaluation `12R + 5` of that sum for this symbol in a grading that mixes `x`-degree and `y`-degree, with the gcd correction `1 + u`, and everything arithmetic downstream of it.

## Open problems

Seven things are left, in rough order of how much would fall. None is adjacent to a famous conjecture, and everything used to state them is defined above.

First, the word strictly. At base `3` the sign law is a theorem in sign at every `D` and in strictness at every even `D`, every odd `D` not `1 mod 3`, and every odd `D <= 241`; what is missing is the class `D = 1 mod 3` beyond `241`.

**Conjecture 11.1 (the valuation gap).** For the base-`3` design and every odd `D = 1 mod 3` with `D >= 13`, `v_2(det M_even) < D - 1`.

The bound `D >= 13` is not decorative: the inequality is false at `D = 7`, where strictness holds by direct evaluation instead. With Theorem 5.4 the conjecture makes `Delta_D != 0` throughout the class above `7`, and with Theorems 5.2, 5.3 and 7.1 the base-`3` sign law becomes strict in every dimension. The cleaner target is the observed `v_2(det M_even) <= n`, true at every odd `9 <= D <= 241` scanned with equality only at `D = 9, 15`, which implies the conjecture since `n < D - 1` for `D >= 5`. Theorem 9.1 pins the first layer `L_1 = tent(D) <= ceil(n/3)` and no more; the rest of the mass sits in the deeper layers `L_k`, observed to decay geometrically with octave maxima at Jacobsthal numbers two indices apart and to pile up only at isolated stacking dimensions, and the `2`-adic Smith form at odd `D` is observed to carry exactly one elementary divisor of valuation `3` or more, while the small-excess constants are domain-limited: `max a_i <= 9` first fails at `D = 127` and `#{a_i >= 2} <= 5` at `D = 183`. The route through a single prime is dead: no prime `p <= 59` keeps `v_p(det M_even) = 0` across `2 <= D <= 40`, every one of them dividing the determinant at some `D <= 30`, `v_3` growing quadratically to `181` at `D = 40`, and the least primes dividing no determinant in that window are `61, 67, 73, 97`; so a nonzero residue of `det M_even` modulo one fixed prime is not the lemma. How the conjecture could fail: by a single spike, some deep `D` whose layers refuse to decay across a whole octave, with no warning from the ranges scanned. At base `5` the odd class `D = 1 mod 5` has only Proposition 4.2 and needs its own bound against `2(D-1) + v_2(D+4)`.

Second, the order. Theorem 3.3 proves exactness of `ceil(D/2)` on a box, and Theorem 3.2 says what is left.

**Conjecture 11.2 (Conjecture R).** At every odd base and every `D >= 2`, `H_D det M_even != 0`, so the minimal order of the central census is exactly `ceil(D/2)` from level `0` and from level `1`.

The polynomial form of Theorem 3.3 takes the base out of it: at each fixed `D` the statement is one polynomial in `(q+1)/2` per class of `q mod 4` with no root at an odd base. Square-freeness and reality of the spectrum of `M_even`, seen in all `156` cases, are not needed and not proved.

Third, the transient's last step. Theorem 8.1 leaves one odd level undecided when `K*(D)` falls within `w(D)` of an odd integer.

**Conjecture 11.3 (the transient, exactly).** `L*(D) = L_0(D)` for every even `D >= 6`, and `K_min(D)` is `L*(D) + 1` or `L*(D) + 2` for every even `D`.

The first half holds at every even `6 <= D <= 130` (Fact 8.3) and Proposition 8.2 decides it at every even `D >= 38` whose `K*(D)` keeps the distance `w(D)` from the odd integers. Beyond `D` about `130` the window `w(D)` is below `10^(-11)` and shrinking like `D^3 0.75^D`, so the conjecture fails only if the explicit analytic function `K*(D) = ((D-1) log R + s_D)/log((D+2)/(D-2))` lands that close to an odd integer at some even `D`, and excluding that for every `D` is a Diophantine statement about `K*(D)` that nothing here addresses; a counterexample would need `V` at the undecided level to take the sign the half-point pair alone does not predict. The second half holds on the `58` rows of Fact 8.3, where `K_min` is pinned exactly and not bracketed, against the proved bracket `[L* + 1, ceil(K*) + 2]`; the way it could fail is visible, a dimension where `K*` falls just above an even integer and the certificate needs `L* + 3`.

Fourth, the even half at every odd base.

**Conjecture 11.4 (the even half at every base).** At every odd base `q >= 5`, `rho_D < f_D/q` for every even `D >= 2`, with certificate depth `K_min(D) = Theta(log_q D)` and no transient.

The template is Theorem 6.1 unchanged: Propositions 6.2 and 6.3 hold at every odd base, Lemma 8.4 kills the `pi`-track for `q = 1 mod 4` and crushes it for `q = 3 mod 4`, `q >= 7`, and what is missing is a separation constant `r(q) < 1` uniform in `K`, a three-branch interval computation of the shape of Lemma 6.4 with a `q`-dependent enumeration at the first branch. The evidence is Fact 8.5. It could fail at a base where the first branch's maximum creeps to `1`; the crushing factor grows with `q`.

Fifth, the exact depth-death law. Proposition 6.6 ports to every odd base and gives the asymptotic death point `D = 2 ceil(q^(K+1)/4) + 2` of the depth-`K` certificate; as an exact law it is already wrong at base `7`, by one even step at `K = 1`.

**Conjecture 11.5 (the frontier race).** Let `f_K(D) = max{c >= 0 : Sigma_K(c) > 0}` on a padded window. At every odd base `K_min(D) = min{K >= 1 : (D-2)/2 <= f_K(D)}`; the asymptotic point is an upper bound on the depth-`K` death, attained exactly when `f_K` converges before the window edge arrives; and above some `K_0(q)` the two agree, with `K_0(5) = 1` and `K_0(7) = 2`.

The evidence is the earliness table of Fact 8.5 and one out-of-sample test, the step `2 -> 3` at base `7` predicted at `D = 174` from a frontier converged at `D = 160` and found there. The frontier is observed to be monotone in `D`, not proved to be; a non-monotone frontier at a composite base would break the "attained exactly when" clause without touching the upper bound.

Sixth, the row certificate's own sign law.

**Conjecture 11.6 (the periodic sign law at base 5).** `(v^T M^k)_j >= 0` if and only if `dist(j, 5^(k+1) Z) <= (5^(k+1) - 1)/4`, the threshold being the carry-drift radius around every multiple of `5^(k+1)` and not only around `0`; witness `D = 40`, `k = 1`, `j = 19` positive.

A proof by induction on `k` from Theorem 4.1(i), tracking the interval structure rather than the entries, would give a second, structural proof of Theorem 6.1, and its base-`3` analogue, if one exists, is the likeliest route to a uniform statement across bases.

Seventh, the spectral picture that every direct route needs and this paper went around. The second eigenvalue of `M_even` at base `3` is observed to track the digit polynomial at `-1`, `lambda_2 -> (-1)^(D+1) 2^(D-1)(D-2)/3` with exponential convergence but never exactly, so the gap closes like `4/D` (Fact 5.6), and the excess `rho_D - f_D/3` is observed to decay like `(-1)^(D+1) (2(D-1)/3) prod_(k >= 2) cos(2 pi/3^k)^(D-1) (D + 2 cos(2 pi/3^k))/(D+2)`, per-dimension factor `prod_(k >= 2) cos(2 pi/3^k) = 0.7428747134...`, within `10^(-8)` at `D = 61`; the Perron vector certifies `p_D > 1/3` numerically at every `D <= 50` with no closed form. None of this is proved, and none of it is needed for the theorems above.

## Reproducibility

Every number of Sections 3, 5, 8 and 9 that the tree regenerates is printed by one of five studies, each run from the repository root and raising if any check fails. `uv run python research/cuts/lab/py/base3-transient-exhaustion/transient.py --selftest --lo 6 --hi 120` prints the `58` rows of Fact 8.3, `L*`, `K_min`, `K*` and the strictness of every row, in about `213` seconds on one core (the `D = 40` row in `0.02` seconds, `D = 120` in `28`), after a self-test that rebuilds `V(L)` from the unfolded census and the unfolded row sweep on all of `S` at even `4 <= D <= 36`; `transient.py --values 40 85 91` prints the values `V(85), ..., V(91)` at `D = 40` with their signs and digit counts, and `transient.py --window 38 130` prints the window table of Fact 8.3, `K*`, `L_0`, `E`, `A`, `w` and the distance to the nearest odd integer at every even `38 <= D <= 130`, each in under a second. `uv run python -I research/cuts/lab/py/even-block-valuations/valuations.py` prints `det M_even` exactly at every `2 <= D <= 40` with its valuations at `p = 2, 3, 5, 7`, the fold identity `det M = det M_even det M_odd` as a control at every `D`, `v_2(det M_even) = 7` at `D = 7` and the `v_2 <= n` rows of Fact 5.5, and with the verb `factor` the complete factorisation behind the dead one-prime route of Conjecture 11.1, in under a second plus the factoring. `uv run python research/spectra/lab/py/spectra-from-cuts/compose.py order 10` prints the exact Hankel determinants and `det M_even` of Theorem 3.3 on the box and the polynomial route for `D <= 10`, with the square-free real spectrum of Fact 3.7, in about three seconds, and its verb `block` the `D = 3` block at every odd base. `uv run python research/spectra/lab/py/smith-cascade/smith_cascade.py` prints the `2`-adic Smith layers at every odd `5 <= D <= 511`, the nullity against the tent of Theorem 9.1 and the `v_2` rows of Fact 5.5, in about three minutes. `uv run python research/cuts/lab/py/slice-ladder-controls/controls.py` prints the hypersimplex counts and the `D = 4` ladder of Fact 3.7 in about three seconds. The figure `paper-slice-sign-law` recomputes the sign of `V(L)` in exact integers at every even `6 <= D <= 40` and every `L <= 91` from the digit polynomial alone, together with `K*(D)` in double precision, and refuses to draw unless every row has an unbroken run of negative odd levels ending at `L_0(D)`, a stopping level at `L* + 1` or `L* + 2`, and the `D = 40` values `87` and `88.77`.

What the tree does not regenerate, and only that, rests on the two shelf papers listed in the References, which carry their own verification and certification: the rational-interval constants of Lemmas 6.4, 7.4, 7.5 and 7.6 and of the proofs of Theorems 6.1 and 7.1 (the `182` inequalities `(*)` and the domination constants), the exact integer certificates of Facts 6.7, 7.8 and 8.5, the base-`5` valuation rows and the exact `Delta_D` to `80` of Fact 5.5, the high-precision spectra of Fact 5.6, and the deep ranges of Fact 9.8. Each is named as such at its point of use, and no theorem of this paper depends on a number that is not either proved on the page or certified there. Every Theorem and every Fact of this paper is also a dated Proved or Verified row of the tree's own claim pages, [the even half](../claims/conjecture-s-even-half.md), [the odd half](../claims/conjecture-s-odd-half.md), [the ladder](../claims/diagonal-slice-ladder.md), [the sign law in every dimension](../claims/slice-sign-law-in-every-dimension.md) and [the tent rank law](../../spectra/claims/tent-rank-law.md), and those rows, not the shelf, are what this paper takes as its sources; the shelf papers are listed for their scripts alone.
