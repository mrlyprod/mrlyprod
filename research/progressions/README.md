# Progression-free digit designs

A digit design with `0` among its digits is free of three-term progressions exactly when its digit set is and the signed set `F + F - 2F` closes no carry walk, carries living in `{-1, 0, 1}`, and three levels decide; the no-carry case is the digit lift of a progression-free subset of `Z_b`; the census to base `40` by the criterion against brute force finds the half-base construction beaten at bases `19`, `35`, `37` and `39`, every winner a cyclic lift and a carry that leaves `0` never paying, and the dimension `log 2/log 3` of the Stanley sequence first passed at base `37` by ten digits; the planar block of Elsholtz, Hunter, Proske and Sauermann is run as a discrete block problem whose potential is a peeling order, every exact grid optimum bounding every planar block from above, so no planar block has area past `19/49` and the route cannot bring the constant below `2.3381`; the grid search tracks `7/24 + 1/m` to `m = 48` and every grid set found above `7/24` dies under dilation, while peelable blocks lifted by a slice give `r_3(Z_m^n)` the constants `4.362, 5.196, 5.477, 6.633, 7.483, 7.745` at `m = 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13`, above every published constant read, and a `36`-point block in `Z_5^3` gives `3.301`, above the `35^(1/3)` read for `F_5^n`.

## Lost

- A digit design as the largest known progression-free subset of `[0, N)`: the base-37 design passes greedy, Behrend and the Salem-Spencer family at `N = 37^7` and loses to the sets of Wroblewski cited at A065825 by `1.21` to `1.31`; the rows are in [claims/four-baselines.md](claims/four-baselines.md).
- The planar climb at `m = 21, 23, 25` as a lower-bound constant for `r_3(Z_m^n)`: the published block at its best shift holds `136, 164, 191` points against the climb's `132, 156, 182`; the rows are in [claims/block-area.md](claims/block-area.md).
