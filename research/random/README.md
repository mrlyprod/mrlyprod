# Random

Randomness from designs: the rounds, where every round that writes two cells or more is even and a census reads which splits reach the alternating group; the design ladder, three no-go rungs for generators built from designs alone; the mess, the nonlinear step, whose Sources all sit below the nonlinearity ceiling past five neighbours; four chapters on top: the moire limit, the schedules, the mixing and the machine; and four on reading a design: along the squares, along polynomials (the readings), along the primes and the major arcs.

## Lost

- One round's spectral gap as the mixing rate: every round that writes two cells or more has `sigma_2(P) = 1`, a difference on the fill passing as a point mass, and the guess that this marks an imprimitive group is refuted by all 147 alternating `3 x 3` cells; the rate is `abs lambda_2` of the chain; the rows in [claims/mixing.md](claims/mixing.md).
- A local spread for fast mixing: the light cone bounds the distance below until the cone covers the torus, so rounds grow with the side; the row in [claims/mixing.md](claims/mixing.md).
- Local conditions alone for a primitive group: a strongly connected reads digraph, spanning second differences and no affine direction, refuted by the `4 x 4` single rounds `0x0055`; the row in [claims/schedules.md](claims/schedules.md).
- An exercised nonlinearity at unbounded depth as an exit from the automatic class: refuted by rule 182 from one cell; the row in [claims/design-ladder.md](claims/design-ladder.md).
- The machine's 2.77 and 5.69 over untransported Rule 30 (5.69 at an earlier `R*`, 4.675 at the current one) as a mixing advantage: it is the grid's light cone against the ring's, and with the same slide Rule 30 comes within 1.06 and 1.18 at the antipodal load; the rows in [claims/machine.md](claims/machine.md).
- One spectral invariant as the ranking of designs by how far from random they read along the squares: the mirror pair `6:5`, `6:12345` has one spectral measure, yet along `n^2`, `n < 2^30`, it reads `X2 = 13152` against `714`; the row in [claims/squares.md](claims/squares.md).
- A polynomial reading with no near-head among the battery pairs as one that passes the battery: at `N = 2^26` Thue-Morse along `n^2 + n` fails the dilation test at `z = 14.42` against the control's `2.81`, and Rudin-Shapiro along `n^3 + n`, though white, fails its kernel test at `z = 17.10`; the row in [claims/readings.md](claims/readings.md).
- The `q = 3` term alone as the main term of `sum_(n<x) t(n) Lambda(n)`: it misses by `31.68 sigma` at `2^31`, where `T_6` cancels a third of it, and the integers prime to 6 still miss by `4.08 sigma` at `2^32`; the row in [claims/primes.md](claims/primes.md).
