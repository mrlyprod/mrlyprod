# The coprimality spine

The coprimality spine: exact base-local factors on every design, the census behind them, the window at dimension one with the band automaton's critical out-degree and its algebraic block rate, and primes on a design, where the least base below the quarter threshold is 21 at one missing digit and 32 at two, the one-digit family closes at 34 and the two-digit family closes at 21 against the third.

## Lost

- Higher moments of the carry matrix toward Lemma B at dimension one: the ladder stops at `0.447931`, never `1/2`, and a per-ray-maximum bound stops at `1/2`, both Proved; absolute-value character bounds have a heuristic ceiling at `0.586752` (The window at dimension one).
- The other routes to Lemma B at dimension one, componentwise Fourier transfer, sieves that drop signs, occupancy: each exact obstacle stands in the obstruction table of The window at dimension one.
- Weil's theorem as a route to the coprimality window: over `F_3[t]` the restricted coprime count grows like `4^n`, a positive density, so the window is empty there (The function field diagnostic; the Refuted row in [claims/coprimality-at-dimension-one.md](claims/coprimality-at-dimension-one.md)).
- `min_x Sigma_1 = 2` at every interior digit of a one-missing-digit set: false at the constant-phase digit `2 a_0 = base - 1`, least counterexample base 3 missing 1, where it is `sqrt 3`; the Refuted row in [claims/primes-on-a-design.md](claims/primes-on-a-design.md).
- The floor `min_s Sigma_1(s) = 2` on the Gaussian one-digit sets: false at 135 orbits; the Refuted row in [claims/gaussian-primes-on-a-design.md](claims/gaussian-primes-on-a-design.md).
- Mitsui's bound as the minor-arc lemma over `Z[i]`: it saves a power of the logarithm, not the power the gate asks (Gaussian primes on a design).
- Separating a smoothed square through the characters: its cost grows like a curved boundary, so that route stops at the gate `1/6`, a reading of one route stated as a Conjecture, while a polar box grows only logarithmically (Gaussian primes on a design).
- A block missed by every off-shift ray, as the uniform route to strictness in Conjecture N: none at any `k`, since the ray `(1, 3^k (1 + 3^t))` realises every distance-`k`-free block of length at most `2t - k`, Proved; witness `(1, 738)` for `11001100010` and `(1, 19692)` for the length-22 join, both missed by all 57 off-shift rays of the height-243 box (The window at dimension one; the Proved row in [claims/gasket-rays-and-the-window.md](claims/gasket-rays-and-the-window.md)).
