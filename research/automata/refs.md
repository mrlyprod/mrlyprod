| Schaller and Svozil 2025 | Irreducible rules and equivalence classes of one-dimensional cellular automata, arXiv:2512.08117; state permutations and lattice isometries generate the symmetry group, extended by neighbourhood scaling, and free permutation of the three neighbourhood coordinates is not among them | https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08117 |

| Langton 1990 | Computation at the edge of chaos: phase transitions and emergent computation, Physica D 42(1-3), 12-37; lambda is the fraction of rule-table entries mapping to a non-quiescent state.

| Mitchell, Hraber and Crutchfield 1993 | Revisiting the edge of chaos: evolving cellular automata to perform computations, Complex Systems 7(2), 89-130; the abstract states the earlier interpretation of lambda's role is not correct | https://www.complex-systems.com/abstracts/v07_i02_a01/ |

It observes rule 90's single-cell pattern has fractal dimension log2 3; it does not prove it and never says Pascal | https://doi.org/10.1007/BF01223745 |
| Willson 1987 | Computing fractal dimensions for additive cellular automata, Physica D 24(1-3), 190-206; the abstract states the largest eigenvalue of an integer matrix built from the automaton gives the fractal dimension.

| Ollinger 2009 | Intrinsically universal cellular automata, EPTCS 1, 199-204; intrinsic universality is undecidable though recursively enumerable, rule 110's Turing universality does not give intrinsic universality, and whether rule 110 is intrinsically universal is open | https://doi.org/10.4204/EPTCS.1.19 |
