# oeis-terms

- Regenerates the two b-files this tree submitted to the OEIS, each by more than one method.
- A396934: pairs `0 <= i, j < 2^n` with `i AND j = 0` and `gcd(i, j) = 1`, for `n = 0..20`.
- The row walk indexes a pair by `m = i + j = i OR j`, keeps the odd submasks of odd rows with `gcd(i, m) = 1`, and doubles; eight threads split the rows.
- Cross-checks: the complement submask walk with `gcd(i, j)` to `n = 14`, and Pascal's triangle mod 2 by the additive recurrence to `n = 12`.
- Prints `a(20)/3^20`, the limit `16/(3*Pi^2)`, and their gap.
- A398348: `n x n x n` binary arrays up to `D_n^3` semidirect `S_3`, order `48*n^3`, by Burnside for `n = 1..14`.
- The cycle walk maps every cell under `(x_0, x_1, x_2) -> (eps_t * x_{p(t)} + s_t mod n)` and walks the cycles.
- Cross-checks: fixed points of the powers of the affine map `x -> M x + t` to `n = 8`, and direct orbit enumeration of all `2^(n^3)` colourings to `n = 2`.
- Uses `mrlynum::factor::coprime` and `num-bigint` for the Burnside sums.

## RUN

- `CARGO_BUILD_JOBS=4 cargo run --release --manifest-path research/lab/Cargo.toml -p oeis-terms`
- An optional argument lowers the top A396934 level, e.g. `-- 16`.
- The full domain runs in under half a minute on eight cores.
