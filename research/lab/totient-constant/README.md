# totient-constant

- The node count of the spun stacks is a totient sum over ideals, and this study proves its constant instead of fitting it.
- It serves `lab/spun-stack` (the Gaussian stack, node count 672, 10608, 168088 at norm bounds 50, 200, 800) and `lab/eisenstein-stack` (the hexagonal stack, 630, 9606, 151020, 337026, 945486, 2419950 at 50, 200, 800, 1200, 2000, 3200), whose limit constants were Conjecture and are now Proved.
- Everything is recounted from scratch here, twice: once by enumerating associate classes and factoring norms, once by the norm-indexed Dirichlet series, which is the route that also carries class number above one.

## THE THEOREM

- Let `K` be an imaginary quadratic field with ring of integers `O_K`, class number `h`, unit group of order `w`, and discriminant `D_K`. Write `N` for the ideal norm and `Phi(a) = |(O_K/a)^*| = N(a) prod_{p | a} (1 - 1/N(p))`.
- Proved: `sum_{N(a) <= N} Phi(a) = (rho_K/(2 zeta_K(2))) N^2 + O(N^(3/2))` with `rho_K = 2 pi h/(w sqrt |D_K|)` the ideal density, the sum running over nonzero ideals.
- At `h = 1` nonzero ideals are nonzero associate classes, which is the spun stacks' index set.
- Proved: for `K = Q(i)`, `h = 1`, `w = 4`, `|D_K| = 4`, the constant is `pi/(8 zeta(2) G) = 0.260634696495` with `G` Catalan's constant.
- Proved: for `K = Q(sqrt -3)`, `h = 1`, `w = 6`, `|D_K| = 3`, the constant is `pi/(6 sqrt 3 zeta(2) L(2, chi_-3)) = 0.235217881630`.
- The error `O(N^(3/2))` is the one derived below and is weaker than the two-signed deviations the two studies print, which are of size `N log N`; those deviations sit inside the theorem and are not claimed to be its true order.

## CONVENTIONS

- The sum is over nonzero integral ideals throughout; at class number one the unit group acts freely on nonzero elements, each class holds exactly `w` elements, and ideals and associate classes are the same monoid.
- `Phi` is the ideal totient, the order of the unit group of `O_K/a`, and it is multiplicative because the Chinese remainder theorem splits `O_K/a`.
- `mu_K` is the ideal Mobius function, `(-1)^k` on a squarefree product of `k` prime ideals and `0` otherwise.
- The Gaussian window is `a + b i` with `a >= 1` and `b >= 0`, one representative per class; the Eisenstein window is `a + b omega` minimal in its orbit under the six units, `omega` acting as `(a, b) -> (-b, a - b)` and `-1` as `(a, b) -> (-a, -b)`.
- Norm bound `N` throughout, never a radius: the height `|q| <= T` of a complex Farey fraction is the norm bound `N = T^2`.

## THE IDEAL COUNT

- Lemma, Proved: `A(t) = #{a : N(a) <= t} = rho_K t + E(t)` with `|E(t)| = O(sqrt t)` and `rho_K = 2 pi h/(w sqrt |D_K|)`.
- First the principal ideals. `O_K` is a rank two lattice in `C` of covolume `sqrt |D_K|/2`, so counting its points in the disc of radius `R = sqrt t` by attaching to each point its fundamental cell, of diameter `delta`, gives cells contained in the disc of radius `R + delta` and covering the disc of radius `R - delta`; dividing the two areas by the covolume gives `2 pi t/sqrt |D_K| + O(sqrt t)` lattice points, and removing the origin and dividing by `w` gives `2 pi t/(w sqrt |D_K|) + O(sqrt t)` principal ideals, with an effective implied constant, `4 pi delta/(w sqrt |D_K|)` at leading order.
- Then one class at a time. Fix an ideal class `C` and an integral ideal `a` in `C^-1`; the map `b -> a b = (x)` is a bijection from the integral ideals of `C` of norm at most `t` to the nonzero elements of `a` of norm at most `t N(a)`, taken up to units, since `(x) a^-1` is integral exactly when `x` lies in `a`.
- `a` is a lattice of covolume `N(a) sqrt |D_K|/2`, so the same cell argument gives `2 pi t/(w sqrt |D_K|) + O(sqrt t)` ideals in every class alike, and summing the `h` classes gives the lemma.
- This is the Gauss circle count for `Z[i]` and the hexagonal count for `Z[omega]`, whose closed forms `sum_j (floor(t/(4j+1)) - floor(t/(4j+3)))` and `sum_j (floor(t/(3j+1)) - floor(t/(3j+2)))` are Verified in `lab/spun-stack` and `lab/eisenstein-stack`; the lemma above is derived here from the lattice and cites neither.
- `rho_K` is also the residue of `zeta_K` at `s = 1` given by the class number formula, which is the cross-check: `pi/4` for `Q(i)` and `pi/(3 sqrt 3)` for `Q(sqrt -3)`.

## THE CONVOLUTION STEP

- The method is Dirichlet convolution followed by Abel summation, not a hyperbola split: the whole `b` range is summed and the inner sum is estimated uniformly.
- Proved: `Phi = N * mu_K` as a Dirichlet convolution on ideals, since both sides are multiplicative and on a prime power `(N * mu_K)(p^k) = N(p)^k - N(p)^(k-1) = Phi(p^k)`; equivalently `sum_a Phi(a) N(a)^-s = zeta_K(s - 1)/zeta_K(s)`.
- Hence `S(N) = sum_{N(a) <= N} Phi(a) = sum_{N(b) <= N} mu_K(b) T(N/N(b))` with `T(X) = sum_{N(c) <= X} N(c)`.
- Abel summation on the lemma gives `T(X) = X A(X) - int_0^X A(u) du = (rho_K/2) X^2 + X E(X) - int_0^X E(u) du`, so `|T(X) - (rho_K/2) X^2| <= (5/3) C X^(3/2)` with `C` the constant of the lemma.
- The main term is `(rho_K/2) N^2 sum_{N(b) <= N} mu_K(b) N(b)^-2`, and the tail `sum_{N(b) > N} N(b)^-2 = O(1/N)` by Abel summation on `A(u) = O(u)`, so the main term is `(rho_K/(2 zeta_K(2))) N^2 + O(N)`.
- The error term is at most `(5/3) C N^(3/2) sum_{N(b) <= N} N(b)^(-3/2) <= (5/3) C zeta_K(3/2) N^(3/2)`, finite because `zeta_K(s)` converges for `s > 1`.
- Adding the two gives the theorem, with an effective implied constant `(5/3) C zeta_K(3/2) + O(1)`.
- Proved, conditional refinement: if the lemma holds with `E(t) = O(t^theta)` for some `0 < theta < 1`, the same three steps give error `O(N^(1 + theta))`; the elementary `theta = 1/2` is the one derived here, and no sharper circle exponent is claimed. The lower constraint is not decoration: at `theta = 0` the error layer needs `zeta_K(1)`, which diverges, and the conclusion drops to `O(N log N)`.

## THE CONSTANTS

- `zeta_K(s) = zeta(s) L(s, chi_D)` for a quadratic field, `chi_D` the Kronecker symbol of the discriminant, so `zeta_K(2) = zeta(2) G` for `Q(i)` and `zeta(2) L(2, chi_-3)` for `Q(sqrt -3)`.
- `c = rho_K/(2 zeta_K(2)) = pi h/(w sqrt |D_K| zeta(2) L(2, chi_D))`, which is `pi/(8 zeta(2) G)` and `pi/(6 sqrt 3 zeta(2) L(2, chi_-3))`.
- `main` prints, at 50 working digits through the Hurwitz form `L(2, chi_D) = |D_K|^-2 sum_a chi_D(a) zeta(2, a/|D_K|)` with Euler-Maclaurin and `pi` by Machin: `zeta(2) = 1.644934066848`, `G = 0.915965594177`, `L(2, chi_-3) = 0.781302412896`, `zeta_K(2) = 1.506703009923` and `1.285190955484`, `rho_K = 0.785398163397` and `0.604599788078`, and the constants `0.260634696495` and `0.235217881630`.
- Those two agree with the values `lab/spun-stack` and `lab/eisenstein-stack` print, `0.260635` and `0.235217881630015`, which are now derived rather than fitted.
- `class_number` derives `h` from the finite character sum `h = w (-sum_a chi_D(a) a)/(2 |D_K|)`, returning 1, 1, 2 and 3 at `D_K = -4, -3, -20, -23`, so the constant is assembled from `w`, `|D_K|`, `h` and `L(2, chi_D)` alone.

## THE GENERAL FIELD

- Proved: the theorem holds for every imaginary quadratic field, of any class number. The convolution step never sees the class number, and the lemma is proved above one ideal class at a time.
- Verified: at `D_K = -20`, `h = 2`, the constant is `0.378582556790` and the count at norm bound 102400 is 3969730264, ratio `1.000001116781`; at `D_K = -23`, `h = 3`, the constant is `0.425700255391` and the count is 4463281160, ratio `0.999885848149` (`norm_totient_sum`).
- Proved as an implication only: for a general number field, with ideals throughout, the convolution step is unchanged and gives `(rho_K/(2 zeta_K(2))) N^2 + O(N^(1 + theta))` for any ideal count `A(t) = rho_K t + O(t^theta)` with `0 < theta < 1`; that ideal count is not derived here, so nothing about degree above two is claimed outright.

## THE FAREY CONVENTION

- The lit set of the spun stack is the complex Farey set: Sayous arXiv:2407.04380 Section 2 defines `F_t = {pr_{O_K}(p/q) : p, q in O_K, p O_K + q O_K = O_K, 0 < |q| <= e^(t/2)}` inside `C/O_K` and states `card F_t ~ c_K e^(2t)` with `c_K = pi/(sqrt |D_K| zeta_K(2))`, attributed there to Cosentino, Ergodic Theory Dynam. Systems 19 (1999) 1437-1484, Theorem 4.
- Since `|q| <= e^(t/2)` is the norm bound `N = e^t`, the two conventions are: counting denominators as ideals gives `pi/(w sqrt |D_K| zeta_K(2)) = rho_K/(2 zeta_K(2))`, and counting them as elements gives `pi/(sqrt |D_K| zeta_K(2))`, exactly `w` times larger, `w = 4` for `Z[i]` and `6` for `Z[omega]`.
- Verified: `farey_set` builds the set `F_t` itself, layer by layer as the union of the lattices `q^-1 O_K` modulo `O_K` over all classes of norm at most `N`, deduplicating points in exact integer coordinates, and returns 672, 10608, 168088 for `Z[i]` and 630, 9606, 151020 for `Z[omega]` at norm bounds 50, 200, 800, equal in all six cases to the totient sum.
- `F_t` is written as a set of points of the torus, so its cardinality is the ideal one; the factor `w` is inherited from the cited Cosentino statement rather than chosen, and `c_K e^(2t)` is the size of the family indexed by element denominators, in which each point repeats once per associate of its denominator.

## WHAT IT PRINTS

- `classes` enumerates one representative per nonzero associate class in each field, 80414 Gaussian and 61914 Eisenstein classes of norm at most 102400.
- `totient` computes `Phi` from the factorisation of the norm alone, splitting rational primes into ramified, inert and split, a split `p` contributing `(1 - 1/p)^2` exactly when `p` divides both coordinates.
- `totient_sum` reads the prefix array built by `tables` and returns 672, 10608, 168088, 372872, 1045088, 2663864, 42663808, 683283504, 2732257376 for `Q(i)` and 630, 9606, 151020, 337026, 945486, 2419950, 38560362, 616981926, 2466558234 for `Q(sqrt -3)` at norm bounds 50, 200, 800, 1200, 2000, 3200, 12800, 51200, 102400, matching the published counts of `lab/spun-stack` and `lab/eisenstein-stack` at all nine bounds where they overlap.
- `main` prints `count/(c N^2)` at those bounds: `1.031329, 1.017516, 1.007684, 0.993494, 1.002445, 0.998113, 0.999097, 1.000066, 0.999746` for `Q(i)` and `1.071347, 1.020968, 1.003192, 0.995017, 1.004904, 1.004699, 1.000578, 1.000604, 1.000049` for `Q(sqrt -3)`, oscillating about 1 rather than approaching it from one side.
- `main` prints the deviation scaled by the derived error, `(count - c N^2)/N^(3/2)`, never larger than `0.119` in absolute value across both fields and all nine bounds, and the same deviation scaled by `N log N`, which reproduces the `+0.214, +0.186, +0.090, -0.198, +0.304, +0.438` of `lab/eisenstein-stack`.
- `convolution_sum` re-evaluates the same totient sum as `sum_{N(b) N(c) <= N} mu_K(b) N(c)` from an independently computed `mu_K`, agreeing at all nine bounds in both fields, which is the numerical form of `Phi = N * mu_K`.
- `farey_set` counts the complex Farey set directly, 672, 10608, 168088 and 630, 9606, 151020 at norm bounds 50, 200, 800.
- `norm_arrays` and `norm_totient_sum` recount by norm alone, with no lattice: the ideals of norm `n` number `sum_{d | n} chi_D(d)`, the ideal Mobius function by norm is `mu * (mu chi_D)` from `1/zeta_K = (1/zeta)(1/L)`, and `S(N) = sum_k m(k) T(N/k)`. This agrees with the class route at all eighteen bounds of the two class-number-one fields and supplies the tables at `D_K = -20` and `-23`.

## WITNESSES

- The theorem's constant: `main` against the counts of `totient_sum` at nine norm bounds in both fields, with the ratio and both scaled deviations.
- The recount: `totient_sum` against the published counts of `lab/spun-stack` and `lab/eisenstein-stack`, nine matches, no mismatch.
- The convolution `Phi = N * mu_K`: `convolution_sum` against `totient_sum`, eighteen agreements.
- Class number above one: `norm_totient_sum` at `D_K = -20` and `-23`, ratios `1.000001116781` and `0.999885848149` at norm bound 102400, with `class_number` deriving `h = 2` and `3`.
- The Farey convention: `farey_set` against `totient_sum`, six agreements, settling that the set convention carries `rho_K/(2 zeta_K(2))` and the element convention `w` times that.
