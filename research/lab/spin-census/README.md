# Spin Census

- Runs the four unrun questions of [spin](../../spin.md) plus the Gaussian Farey, and prints only.
- The spin mass `M(r)` is read twice: exactly, as the integer shell histogram of filled cells about a fixed point, and through `mrlynum::spin::profile` with `mass_within`, the two agreeing to `1.7e-6` on the total and to `0.5%` on partial radii. The hole about the raster centre is measured on cell rectangles in exact integer arithmetic, never on cell centres, which would return `hole + 1/2` whatever the hole.
- Every fixed point is the attractor of one filled digit `d`, the point `d/2` of the unit square, about which the design is exactly self-similar; the corner digit gives the widest window, `r <= side`, the centre digit only `r <= side/2`.
- The ripple is the residual `ln M(r) - D ln r` with `D = log(fill)/log 3` taken exactly, never fitted, folded into 24 bins of `log_3 r` over a whole number of periods so every bin carries the same sample count. Its drift bar is the same fold on the first half of the window against the second, computed from the code itself.
- Level 6 and level 7 for the census over all 256 codes with a filled corner digit, de-duplicated to transpose classes because the corner ripple is a class function; the transpose control asks the same code and its mirror for the same ripple and gets it to the last bit. The window's whole periods are counted by repeated multiplication, never by a logarithm, which floors to the wrong period at level 8.
- The powder is the arithmetic ring average of `|F(k)|^2` over 240 logarithmic bins, band `3 pad/side` to `pad/8` in frequency index, at level 7 with pad 4096 and again with pad 8192 on three codes; the instrument spread is a three-period fit window slid a quarter period at a time across the band, not a split of the band in two, which understates it by an order.
- The spin spectrum is `mrlynum::spin::harmonics` at levels 1 and 2 over all 511 nonempty codes, orders `m = 0..12`, compared against the 101 orbits of the square group.
- The sponge shadow counts lattice lines in direction `(a,b,c)` meeting the level-`L` sponge, as classes of filled cells under `x -> x cross v`, with the solid cube in the same direction as the exact ceiling.
- The Gaussian Farey counts radii new at scale `n` three ways: the direct union over reduced squared radii, the square-free rule, and the Mobius identity over the radical.

## RUN

- `CARGO_BUILD_JOBS=4 cargo run --release --manifest-path research/lab/Cargo.toml -p spin-census`
- About thirty seconds; prints only, writes nothing. Peak memory is the pad-8192 transform, about 1.1 GB.

## WITNESSES

- spin.md the spin dimension rows: slopes `1.465054, 1.649432, 1.783588, 1.761814, 1.897854, 1.879522, 2.000100` about the corner at level 6 against the exact `log(fill)/log 3`.
- spin.md the centre hole: codes 239 and 495 have first occupied radius `41.000` against `side/6 = 40.5` at level 5, mass zero inside.
- spin.md the acid test: `127` against `239` ripple gap `0.11984` on drift bar `0.04126`; `255` against `495` gap `0.12042` on bar `0.01461`; the solid 511 ripple flat at `0.00277` under its own bar `0.00578`.
- spin.md the ripple census: 256 codes read at levels 6 and 7, transpose control `0.00e0`, 13 equal-fill transpose class pairs inside their own bar at level 6 and 6 at level 7 with ratios `0.71` to `0.95`, closest `7` and `273` at `0.01371` with swings `0.01114` and `0.01217`.
- spin.md the powder: pad 4096 slopes `-1.37986, -1.51762, -1.73012, -1.83071, -1.97886, -2.00433`, slide spreads `0.1652` to `0.4405`, pad 8192 moving `127, 255, 495` to `-1.81607, -2.03225, -2.12289`; the fractal slide floor `-2.27308` against the solid's `-2.75781`.
- spin.md the centre hole: four times the squared distance to the nearest filled cell `6561 = (side/3)^2` for `239` and `495` at level 5, `12802` for `79`.
- spin.md the spectrum: 0 isospectral pairs, 101 distinct spectra against 101 nonempty square classes.
- spin.md the shadow: `(0,0,1)` sponge `8, 64, 512, 4096, 32768` against cube `9, 81, 729, 6561`; `(1,1,1)` sponge and cube both `19, 217, 2107, 19441, 176419`.
- spin.md the Gaussian Farey: `2, 3, 9, 11, 22, 18, 40, 38, 55, 52, 91, 64, 123, 97, 128, 126, 199, 136, 243, 180`, the Mobius identity to `n = 64`, the radical-six ratios `0.56250` to `0.63801`.
- `mrlynum::spin::mass_within` and the crate test `the_spin_mass_scales_by_the_fill_about_a_filled_corner`; the window regression test `the_window_counts_whole_periods_at_every_level`.
