# digit-sum-twist

- The numbers of [gelfond](../../../notes/gelfond.md): the two-position constant and the exponent it buys, a falsification of the lemma on the supremum of the twisted transform, a check of the twisted peel, and the twisted Mobius and von Mangoldt meters and the digit-sum classes of the primes of two base-10 designs below `10^7`.
- `lemma`: the constant `c = 1 - min(G_1, G_2, G_3)/fill` in its pair, kernel and variance forms at base 10 missing `7` over sixteen classes of `alpha`, with `gamma`; then `1/5 - alpha_1`, `c`, `gamma`, `sigma` and `delta_0` at `base 92317` (step 3 constant), `39363` (chord constant, middle digit) and `10^6`, at `beta = 1/2`, `0.2` and `10^-3`, the variance form read at the extreme excluded digit; the base where `sigma` overtakes `1/5 - alpha_1`, by bisection between `92317` and `10^6` at `beta = 1/2` and `0.2`; the sharpness example `F = {0, 2}` at base 5, `alpha = 1/8`, read at `k = 4, 8, 12`; and the step 3 margin at `92316`; then the step 3 wall in `mpmath` interval arithmetic at 200 bits, `1/5 - alpha_1` enclosed at `92317` and `92316`, lower end floored and upper end rounded up at nine digits.
- `sup`: `sup_t abs(hat w_k(t))/fill^k` at `k = 1..8` at base 10 missing `7` and `k = 1..4` at base 37 missing `18`, bracketed by a max-product pass over windows of `W` base-`b` digits of `t` (6 at base 10, 4 at base 37), each window factor bounded by its centre value plus the Lipschitz margin `pi h sum(F)`, and by the value attained at the best path refined on a local grid; each off-lattice class is set against `(1 - c)^(floor(k/2))`, each lattice class against the exact value `1` at `t = -alpha`.
- `peel`: the shifted-grid supremum `B_10(F)` at missing `7` on `2 * 10^5` shifts with its Lipschitz margin, then `960` checks of `Sigma_i(s) <= B^i`, of the one-step bound and of the one-step identity at depths `1..5`, and the unshifted twisted mass `Sigma_5(0)`.
- `meter`: `abs(M_F(x; alpha))/A_F(x)` at `10^4..10^7`, its running maximum, and `psi_F(x; alpha)/psi_F(x)` at `10^5..10^7` against the Ramanujan value on the lattice and against the average of `e(alpha s_b(n))` over the design's elements coprime to `90` off it, for base 10 missing `7` and missing `0`.
- `lattice`: the primes of base 10 missing `7` and missing `0` above `30` and below `10^6` and `10^8`, counted by `p mod 9`, `s_10(p) mod 2, 3, 6, 18` and `(p mod 9, s_10(p) mod 6)`, `(p mod 7, s_10(p) mod 3)`, each class against the law of the section Progressions and every modulus in units of the square root of its predicted count, and against the design's `8`-digit strings prime to `30030`, read exactly by a digit recursion on `(n mod 90090, s mod 2)`; the even share of those strings prime to `30`, `210`, `330`, `390`, `2310` and `30030`; `abs(g_F(1/(2(b + 1))))/fill`; and the bias from `11`, the even share prime to `330` less prime to `30`, at `6`, `7`, `8`, `10` and `12` digits, with its ratio over two digits at even counts.
- `gelfond`: the primes of the same two designs below `10^7` counted by `s_10(p) mod q` at `q = 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 3, 9`, against `1/q` and against the elements of the design coprime to `90`.

## THE ROUNDING

- The large-base constants are computed in `mpmath` at 40 digits and floored at four significant digits, so every printed `c`, `gamma`, `sigma`, `delta_0` and `1/5 - alpha_1` is a lower bound.
- The base-10 constants are floats printed at six digits and quoted on the page truncated at three or four.
- The supremum's upper bracket is a float computation with an explicit Lipschitz margin; it is a reading, never a certificate; the generator raises if the attained bracket exceeds the proved bound, a refutation, or if the upper bracket does at `k >= 2`, an inconclusive reading.
