# kummer-carry

- The numbers of [kummer](../../../notes/kummer.md): the set of `k` with `p` not dividing `C(3k, k)` as a two-state carry automaton, the mass of every Kummer set `{k : p does not divide C(ak, bk)}`, the matrix transfer certificate in the row-0 basis, its walls, a falsification of every inequality behind it, readings of the true rate and a sanity meter.
- `kummer`: the four digit intervals, the row sums `(p+1)/2` and the pair `{0, 1}` at every prime `5..2999`; the witness `u, v p, u + v p` against a digit design at every one of them; the automaton against Kummer's carry count `(s_p(k) + s_p(2k) - s_p(3k))/(p - 1)` at every `k < p^5` for `p = 5, 7, 11, 13`, at every `k < 101^3` directly, and at every `k < 101^5` through `k = 101^2 q + r`, the digit sums splitting exactly over the carry classes of `r`.
- `family`: the count `((p+1)/2)^L` read off Legendre's digit sums for every `2 <= a <= 7`, `1 <= b < a`, prime `a < p <= 37`, and where it fails at `p <= a`; the row count and the pair over every state of every `(a, b)` with `a <= 12` and prime `a < p < 400`; the row deviations at `p = 10007`; the product-set test below `p^3` at every `2 <= a <= 6`, `1 <= b < a`, prime `a < p <= 31`; the row-0 limit designs and their constant against `3 - 4 gcd(a, b)/a`.
- `wall`: the constants `nu^+`, `H^+`, `nu_1^+`, `H_1^+` as grid maxima plus a Lipschitz slack; the closed form `lambda/fill` in `mpmath` interval arithmetic at 120 bits; the tail constant `c_inf`; the walls at `1/5` and `1/4`, each certified at every prime from the wall to the point where the tail takes over and failing at the prime below; the spread by class of `p mod 12`; the crossings of `0.22` and `0.18`.
- `check`: `G*`, `G_01`, `C`, `D` summed directly at every prime `13..401` and six larger primes on `201` shifts against their pointwise bounds and closed forms, and `T psi <= lambda psi`; the product formula and the row-0 basis against the direct transform at level `3`; the shifted grid sums by FFT against `lambda^i`.
- `rate`: power iteration of the row-0 operator on a grid of cells with linear interpolation, the exact unshifted grid sums of `K` and of the row-0 design `F*` by FFT, and both offsets carried to the bar `1/5`; readings that bound nothing.
- `meter`: the Mertens meter and the prime count on `K` at `p = 101`, `1009`, `10007` below `10^7`, a sanity print far below every wall.
- `small`: the prime count with prime powers on `K` at `p = 5, 7, 11, 13` up to `10^8`, `A_K(10^8)` counted exactly through the blocks by state and checked against direct membership at `10^6`, a falsification print.

## THE ROUNDING

- `wall` takes each constant as its grid maximum plus half a grid step times a Lipschitz constant plus `10^-12`, rounded up at the sixth decimal; every closed form runs in interval arithmetic at 120 bits, lower bounds print their lower end truncated down, upper bounds their upper end rounded up.
- `kummer` and `family` are exact integer computations.
- `check` runs in float64 and asserts strict inequalities whose margins sit far above float error.
- `rate`, `meter` and `small` print readings.

## RUN

## WITNESSES

- The automaton: `0` mismatches at every `k < p^5` for `p = 5, 7, 11, 13, 101`; `abs(K below 101^5) = 345025251 = 51^5`.
- The mass: `0` mismatches of `((p+1)/2)^L` at `p > a`; `0` of `73654` rows off `(p+1)/2`; the pair in every state at `p >= 2a - 1`; `(3, 1)` at `p = 3` holds `1` integer below `3^11`.
- The constants: `nu^+ = 1.854292`, `H^+ = 5.672774`, `nu_1^+ = 1.287903`, `H_1^+ = 3.861981`; `2 nu^+/pi <= 1.180479`, `c_inf <= 7.482879`.
- The wall at `1/5` is `13567831`, certified at all `34446` primes `13567831..14133194`, least gap `>= 4.8500 * 10^-6` at `13567859`, failing at `13567811` with gap `<= -9.8373 * 10^-6`; `1/5 - alpha_1 >= 7.5864 * 10^-5` at the wall and `>= 1.1060 * 10^-8` at `13567859`, the least over the certified primes. The wall at `1/4` is `227189`, failing at `227177`.
- The row-0 constant `3 - 4 gcd(a, b)/a` at every `a <= 7`; row deviations at most `2a - 4` digits at `p = 10007`; over `127` cells only `(2, 1)` is a product set below `p^3`.
- The small primes: `psi_K/((p/(p+1)) A_K)` at `10^8` reads `1.0032`, `1.0041`, `1.0010`, `1.0051` at `p = 5, 7, 11, 13`.
- The check: `G*/bound <= 0.765814`, `G_01/bound <= 0.897928`, `T psi/(lambda psi) <= 0.905536`, grid sums at most `0.480589` of `lambda^i`.
- Readings: the row-0 operator `(10/(3 pi)) log p + 3.25..3.39`; the exact grid sums of `K` `(10/(3 pi)) log p + 1.40..1.49`.
