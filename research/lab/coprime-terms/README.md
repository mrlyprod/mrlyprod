# coprime-terms

- Exact `A(n)`, the points of a base-3 mask design at level `n` with coprime coordinates, without walking the `k^n` points: the Menger sponge to `n = 18`, the Sierpinski carpet and the Vicsek plus to `n = 20`.
- Mask form: with `mask(x)` the set of base-3 positions where `x` has digit 1 (a digit away from 1 for the plus), a point lies in the level set iff its coordinate masks are pairwise disjoint.
- Mobius over the common divisor with the base prime peeled: `A(n) = W(n) - W(n-1)` where `W(n) = Sum_{m < 3^n, gcd(m,3) = 1} mu(m) (N_n(m) - 1)`, since `N_n(3m) = N_{n-1}(m)` whenever the zero digit vector is filled; the plus has `A(n) = W(n)` and no `-1`.
- `N_n(m)` is a pairwise-disjoint count over the masks of the `Y = ceil(3^n / m)` multiples of `m`, on at most `2^n` masks whatever the box; the sponge splits its moduli by `Y` over five counters, each cheapest in its band by measurement.
- `tail`, `Y <= 3`: closed forms `N - 1 = 3 + 4 [mask(m) = 0]` for `Y = 2` and `6 + 7 [mask(m) = 0] + 7 [mask(2m) = 0] + 6 [mask(m), mask(2m) disjoint]` for `Y = 3`, so the top two bands of `W(n)` are Mertens sums over automatic sets.
- `bitset`, `Y <= (512 n 2^n)^(1/3)`: one `Y`-bit row per multiple marks its disjoint partners and `N = 6 T + 3 z (Y - 1) + z`, `T` the popcount sum of row pairs above the diagonal and `z` the zero-mask multiples; about `Y^3 / 1000` cycles against `Y^3 / 100` for the nested loops it replaces.
- `rows`, `U <= 6 sqrt(n 2^n)` distinct masks: one `u16` zeta transform `g` of the mask histogram, then `2 Sum_{a < b disjoint} c_a c_b g(complement(a | b))` plus the zero-mask diagonal, the disjoint pairs read off bitset rows built four masks per NEON lane inside buckets keyed by the top six bits.
- `cube`, the rest: `u32` ranked zeta transforms truncated at rank `K ~ n/2` with the rare heavier masks folded back by subset enumeration, then `N = Sum_T <c_hat(complement T), Delta[sq(T)]>` per set `T`, `sq` the square of the rank polynomial and `Delta` its binomial difference table, in wrapping `u64` where `Y^3 < 2^64` and `u128` otherwise.
- `residue`: the automaton on `(Z/m)^3` for `m <= 16`; the earlier nested-loop, zeta and ranked-convolution counters stay as references inside the gate.
- Cost: `3^n` moduli a level; the `bitset`/`rows` crossover costs `3^n (n 2^n)^(2/3) / 8` and the `rows`/`cube` balance `3^n n 2^(n/2)` cycles, so the level ratio in `terms/menger.txt` is `4.32` from `n = 17` (`28.317 s`) to `18` (`122.294 s`) on eight threads, `3.7x` and `3.8x` the `104 s` and `463 s` of coprime.md:330, and tends to `4.76` only past `n = 22`.
- `check` gates the engine: direct enumeration to `n = 6` for the sponge and `8` for the plane designs, every counter agreeing with every other on every modulus to level 8, each counter pinned alone agreeing with auto to level 8 (`bitset`), 10 or 11, 45 probed moduli at the sample level across counters, two pinned level-19 probes for the `u64` cube gate (`m = 440`) and the `u32` rows branch (`m = 3^8 + 1`), the `3m` peel identity, and the fill `N_n(1) = k^n`.
- `terms/` holds the three ladders with seconds per level and their b-files.

## RUN

- `CARGO_BUILD_JOBS=4 cargo run --release --manifest-path research/lab/Cargo.toml -p coprime-terms -- terms menger 18 8`
- Arguments: design (`menger`, `carpet`, `vicsek`), top level, threads.
- `-- check menger 6 14` runs the gate battery; `-- profile menger 16 8` prints seconds per `log2 Y` band and counter for one level; `cargo test --release --manifest-path research/lab/Cargo.toml -p coprime-terms` pins the stored terms.
- The sponge ladder to `n = 14` takes 1 s, to `n = 18` about 2.5 min (`terms/menger.txt`).

## WITNESSES

- coprime.md:330: the sponge ladder `A(10) .. A(18)`, ending `215134797774716879278017`, with the 104 s and 463 s timings of the previous engine.
- DISCOVERIES.md:161: the same ladder and the gate battery.
- A399364: DATA `n = 0..17` and the b-file `terms/menger_bfile.txt` to `n = 18`.
