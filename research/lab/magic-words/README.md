# Magic Words

- Regenerates the order-sensitivity section of [connectivity](../../connectivity.md): the two sensitivity tables, the minimal witness, the order-blind laws, the rational-series representation, the component growth families, and the component exponent along a word with its closed forms on all 105 letter pairs, its frequency comparison, its named-word value with a certificate, and its boundary witnesses.
- A word is an ordered list of base-2, `D = 2` codes folded by the Kronecker product, first letter outermost; bit `i` of a code is residue corner `i` in row-major order, so code 3 is the top row and code 5 the left column. The empty word is the one filled cell.
- Observables are fixed once and printed once: `fill`; the main-diagonal count; `boundary`, the number of filled cells with a void or exterior 4-neighbour; `components`, 4-connected; `holes`, the bounded 4-connected components of the complement; the Euler characteristic `N - A + Q` over cells, face-adjacent pairs and full `2 x 2` blocks; the anti-diagonal profile, filled cells by `i + j`; and the row and column contact counts.
- The exposed-face reading `4N - 2E` of [the race](../../connectivity.md) is a second observable under the same word "boundary" and is printed beside the first, because it is order-sensitive at length 2 where the cell count is not.
- Length 3 runs over a ten-code library. The library is every code of fill 2 or 3, the 15 non-empty codes less the four one-cell codes and the full tile; the study also scans all 3003 ten-code subsets and prints how many reproduce the page's length-3 row, which is one.
- The rational series is rebuilt from scratch by Hankel-basis elimination in exact rational arithmetic over `i128` fractions in lowest terms, checked-multiplied so an overflow panics rather than wraps. Prefixes are taken in breadth-first order and rows are read on all 241 suffixes of length at most 2; the basis words, the matrices, `lambda` and `gamma` are outputs, never inputs.
- The representation is then checked against direct geometry on all 54240 words of length 1 to 4 over the 15 codes and on 120 words of length 5 to 7 drawn at a fixed seed, for all four observables.
- The growth section prints the component count of `(15^(L-1), 6)`, `(15^(L-1), 3)` and `(7^(L-1), 6)` at `L = 2..10` against the closed forms `2 * 4^(L-1)`, `2^(L-1)` and `2 * 3^(L-1)`, each proved from the contact law before it is printed, and confirms the matrix product predicts every one of them.
- `2 * 4^(L-1)` is the largest component count any subset of the `2^L` grid can have: one cell per component is an independent set, and a grid with a perfect matching has no independent set above half its cells. The study attains the bound exhaustively at lengths 2 to 4 and through the representation at length 5.
- `kappa`, the number of components meeting a contact position and so still able to merge with a neighbouring copy, is printed on `(15^(L-1), 3)` and maximised exhaustively at lengths 1 to 4.
- The cocycle section takes the rate rather than the count. It prints the per-letter constant-word data that pins the frequency functional `Phi(f) = (f_6 + f_9) log 2`, then the closed forms of the seven pair families, each checked on every word of length at most 14 over the pair against the representation and on every word of length at most 7 against the drawn cells.
- The zero-contact cut is checked where its hypothesis holds and counted where it does not, over all 54240 words of length at most 4, so the law ships with its own scope.
- Thue-Morse is read exactly: equal letter counts at every even length, the longest terminal run, the distribution of the terminal run over every length to `2^20`, the run census, and the identity of the run-boundary word with the period-doubling word.
- The rate table prints, per family, the limit, the constant-word prediction, the fill rate, and the exact prefix rate at `L = 2^20` under both letter readings, and asserts the prefix rate sits within `2/L` of the limit.
- The simplex boundary is printed as three words over `(3, 6)` at one frequency vector, with rates 0, 1 and none, so the positive-frequency hypothesis of every rate above is visible rather than assumed.
- The last section closes the other 46 letter pairs. Five families are checked the same way, on every one of the `2^13` words over each pair against the representation and every word of length at most 7 against the drawn cells; four of them are one zero-contact rule read four times and the fifth is the gasket against a domino, whose count is a sum of prefix fills rather than a power of 2, which is why the sweep evaluates the rule rather than an exponent.
- The frequency ledger is re-derived from the closed forms pair by pair, never copied: how many of the 105 pairs saturate the fill ceiling, how many refute `Phi`, and how many sit strictly between the constant-word values and the ceiling.
- The Thue-Morse value is printed with its certificate. Counts along a gasket-and-domino word are astronomical, so the study works with `log2 comp` factored through the largest term of the sum, which is exact to the last printed digit; every rate is a labelled float, every saturation extremum small enough to name is an exact rational, and the certificate is asserted at every length from 4 to `2^14` on all 16 pairs and both letter readings.
- The invariant cone is printed in exact rationals and checked against the raw matrices step by step, together with the three reasons it does not give the rate: the wrong direction of the orbit, the observation functional sitting on the boundary of the dual cone, and the matrix-norm exponent along `3^inf` being a different number from the component exponent.
- The boundary frequency is printed twice, once over `(3, 6)` where a diagonal letter carries it and once over `(3, 7)` where no diagonal letter exists, and the second sweep prints a whole block of lengths so the accumulation set is visible as an interval rather than as two sampled points.
- Every geometric figure is cross-checked against `mrlymath::bang::magic` cell for cell on all 225 words of length 2 and all 3375 of length 3, so two independently written renderers stand behind every count.
- Block reduction gets the same treatment: a periodic word rendered flat by the study is compared cell for cell with `Tensor::fractal` of its one-period composite, on six cases at periods 2 and 3 and lengths to 6.
- Structural laws are asserted, not the headline counts: the study exits nonzero if a product law, a closed form, the matching bound, the representation or the factory cross-check fails.

## RUN

- `CARGO_BUILD_JOBS=4 cargo run --release --manifest-path research/lab/Cargo.toml -p magic-words`
- About two seconds; prints only, writes nothing, and holds one `1024 x 1024` raster at a time.
