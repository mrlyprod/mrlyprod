# Hexagon Moire

- The stack of diagonal cube slices, one hexagon per odd side n, for the carpet, net, tree and void designs.
- Cut ink of every layer as an exact rational against the four closed forms, and the void centre cell.
- Exact area-weighted Pearson correlations of layer pairs on the full hexagon: the doubling sign law, its Richardson limit, adjacent and gcd-echo pairs, the other families.
- The pair limit in closed form: the cut cell law s_y = s_x + s_z + w, the phase map n = a m + c, and the exact rational correlation of every family against every phase map, with the finite-layer gap beside it.
- The ideal-frame stack at 3601 samples per axis: quarter-line bands, the one-sided plateau at X = 1/4, the void star.
- The twisted triangle averages and the coarse crosshair law at 200003 samples.
- The ghost star of the rendered carpet stack on a 1200 by 2399 raster, and its log-corrected decay in the ideal and the lattice frame.
- The cell frame of the ghost star: the arm's rational ink law to n = 2001, the decay ladders at L = 0 mod 4, L = 2 mod 4 and odd L out to L = 6400, and the band half-widths with their held-out predictions.
- The width family in closed form: the derived tail weight E(K) against its 8-periodic run, the per-layer identity in exact rationals at 14 distinct half-widths broken out by n mod 8, and the summed ladders with the constant, both 1/L^2 branches and the sliding window's own L residue trap.
- The constants from the mrlynum series and the partial character sums at N = 53 and 55.
- The one-layer law: the six ink-law coefficients of each family, the summed identity against the counted hexagons in exact rationals, and the approach in both classes of the layer count.
- Every domain is the source's own; nothing was shrunk. Under a minute.
