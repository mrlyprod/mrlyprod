# Walk Dimension

- The walk dimension `d_w` of the nine census designs by two readings: Laplacian eigenvalue level ratios `lambda_k(L)/lambda_k(L+1) = q^d_w` on the giant component, and the mean squared displacement of 20000 blind ants, `MSD(t) = t^(2/d_w)`, fitted from `t = 32` below `(side/6)^2`.
- Three anchors first: the solid grid and the path drawn by code 7 against the closed form `2 - 2 cos(pi/n)` and `d_w = 2`, and the corner-glued Sierpinski gasket against `tau = 5`, `d_w = log 5 / log 2`.
- The base-3 class census: 26 classes of the 72-element wreath group with orbits summing to 512, the giant share of every representative at levels 4 and 5, and over all 511 codes which giant components touch all four walls at level 5 and how many classes they fall in.
- Code 127 read on four modes at two level pairs, and the weight of its slowest mode inside the block hanging from tile cell (2,0) at level 4.
- Level pairs 4 to 5 in base 3 with 3 to 4 as the drift bar, 6 to 7 for the base-2 design, 3 to 4 for the sponge (160000 nodes); walkers at level 5, 8 and 4, gasket at level 8.
- The two-panel census figure: `d_w` by both readings per design, and `d_s = 2 d_f / d_w` against `d_f` with the gasket starred.
- Dense eigenvalues through faer up to 2000 nodes, above that a block Krylov Rayleigh-Ritz projection through a projected conjugate gradient; the walker stream is seeded but its digits are not the recorded ones, so the walker column agrees to about 0.01 and the gasket gate to 1.6%.

## RUN

- `CARGO_BUILD_JOBS=4 cargo run --release --manifest-path research/lab/Cargo.toml -p walk-dimension`
- About six minutes; rewrites `research/figures/walks-fig.png`.
