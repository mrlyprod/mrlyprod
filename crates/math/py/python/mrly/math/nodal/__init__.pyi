    """Rings the plate cut as the design `math::two::create(code, number, level, 0, 2)`: its cells joined to their four neighbours, free at the rim and at every hole, the combinatorial Laplacian `D - A`. Returns the lowest `count` modes, `count` clamped to the cells and to 64, each in a canonical basis: eigenvalues within `1e-8` form a cluster, split by the design's transpose, left-right and up-down mirrors in that order and then by the diagonal `x + sqrt(2) y`, each figure projected exactly onto its mirror parities and signed so its first largest cell is positive. A figure's domains are the 4-connected runs of one strict sign, cells within `1e-9` of its peak left out; its bound is the 1-based index of the last member of its cluster, the last cluster closed before the cut."""
