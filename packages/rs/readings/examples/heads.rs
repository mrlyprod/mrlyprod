// A near head is an exact shortcut: the reading at scale*n + offset is a signed copy of the reading at n.
// For n^2, (2n)^2 = 4 n^2 is n^2 shifted two places, and Thue-Morse ignores shifts, so the sign at 2n equals the sign at n.
// Columns: scale and offset, the digits shifted (level), the sign that comes out, and whether it is exact.
